"Title: Insurers Blame Trump For ObamaCare Premiums Skyrocketing  Article: Washington state and New York released projections Monday that revealed insurers in their individual markets are seeking to raise premiums dramatically. As Obamacare premiums continue to skyrocket, insurance companies are blaming president Donald Trump for the price hike citing the removal of the individual mandate. Theres still a great deal of uncertainty in individual markets across the country, fueled by the Trump administrations efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, Washington insurance commissioner Mike Kreidler said in a statement. Instead of getting behind solutions that shore up these markets, the administration seems solely focused on undermining our health insurance system and the individuals and families who need to buy their coverage in the individual market. Well, thats not exactly what removing the individual mandate did. Lets call a spade a spade, shall we? The individual mandate was a government dictate demanding that all Americans purchase health insurance that was the right kind of insurance as determined by the government. So because people are no longer forced to purchase their product at gunpoint or under threats of extortion, the insurance companies are throwing a fit and punishing those who still buy their product. Supporters of the individual mandates repeal cite the drastic increase in premiums that hit prior to repeal in making the case that the system was inefficient long before the Trump administration introduced greater uncertainty.",1
"Title: Gang of Somali Muslim Kids Attacked Maine Residents In Park With Sticks & Fists  Article: Because our government thinks it proper to import some of these kinds of people, this kind of thing happens. A mob of Somali Muslim youths attacked park goers with sticks and fists last week in Kennedy Park in Lewiston, Maine. The mob, which consisted of at least 20 youths, laughed as they beat two men in the park.

"Title: Cops Raid Little Boys Lemonade Stand, Shut it Down for Not Having a Permit  Article: Common sense, among those who work inside the state, is a rare commodity. Agents of the state, like those who work in law enforcement, often become so blinded to reality by just doing my job they throw logic and reason to the wayside, choosing authority and force instead. Nothing highlights this blind order following quite like police tormenting two young boys for the crime of selling lemonade without a permit. Jennifer Knowles, mother of three boys, wanted to instill a bit of entrepreneurial spirit in her sons over the Memorial Day weekend. So, Knowles and her husband decided they would have her four and six-year-old sons run a lemonade stand. We have never had a lemonade stand and the boys thought Memorial Day weekend is going to be great weather, so why not have a lemonade stand across the street in the park, Knowles said. take our poll - story continues below  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

"Title: Chernobyl AIDS  Infinite Unknown  Article: For your information. PDF: Geomagnetic Storms, EMP and Nuclear Armageddon (Nexus Magazine Article)  Geomagnetic Storms, EMP and Nuclear Armageddon (Nexus Magazine Article) (When Technology Fails): There are nearly 450 nuclear reactors in the world, with hundreds more either under construction or in the planning stages. There are 104 of these reactors in the USA and 195 in Europe. Imagine what havoc it would wreak on our civilization and the planets ecosystems if we were to suddenly witness not just one or two nuclear melt-downs but 400 or more! How likely is it that our world might experience an event that could ultimately cause hundreds of reactors to fail and melt down at approximately the same time? I venture to say that, unless we take significant protective measures, this apocalyptic scenario is not only possible but probable. Consider the ongoing problems caused by three reactor core meltdowns, explosions, and breached containment vessels at Japans Fukushima Daiichi facility, and the subsequent health and environmental issues. Consider the millions of innocent victims that have already died or continue to suffer from horrific radiation-related health problems (Chernobyl AIDS, epidemic cancers, chronic fatigue, etc) resulting from the Chernobyl reactor explosions, fires, and fallout. If just two serious nuclear disasters, spaced 25 years apart, could cause such horrendous environmental catastrophes, it is hard to imagine how we could ever hope to recover from hundreds of similar nuclear incidents occurring simultaneously across the planet.",0
"Title: Erdogan's Threat to Jerusalem  Article: In an unprecedented move, President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday, December 6, 2017, that the U.S. recognizes Jerusalem as Israels official capital. In an almost 20-minute speech, President Trump said, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Trump added, For more than two decades previous presidents have signed a waiver to delay moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, and while previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver, today, I am delivering. Turkeys dictator, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is at it again, threatening Israel with cutting off diplomatic relations should the Trump administration recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital. In a meeting with a parliamentary group of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Erdogan stated that, This (referring to U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital) could go as far as cutting our diplomatic relations with Israel. You cannot take such a step. He furthermore warned the Trump administration that recognizing Jerusalem would be a red line for Muslims. He suggested that Turkey will take measures in the event of a possible U.S. move, including the convening of the 57 nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Istanbul. Erdogans bluster regarding President Trumps announcement on Jerusalem included such a far-fetched statement as, Such a move would not only be a violation of international law, but also a big blow the conscience of humanity.",0
"Title: The Trump Collusion Conspiracy Theory Falls Apart  Article: Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. Robert Mueller was appointed to investigate Russian collusion back in May. A new year is upon us. The warm May temperatures have been replaced by a deep freeze and snow is falling in Tallahassee. But after blowing through around $7 million and putting on an exciting show of surprise raids, gag orders, leaks and the varying pleas and indictments; Mueller still hasnt produced a single collusion indictment. Its much easier to pick Manaforts lock than to prove Hillary Clintons conspiracy theory. What Mueller did was harass a bunch of already shady characters into pleading guilty on minor charges, some, like lying to the FBI, created by his own investigation. All he had to do was get his team of Obama and Clinton supporters in front of Obama and Clinton judges who would rubber stamp anything. And the grand jury allegedly looked like a Bernie Sanders or Black Lives Matter rally with some participants wearing left-wing shirts. There wasnt a single white male among the 20 jurors. Thats a convenient way to screen out likely Trump supporters and bring in likely Trump opponents. Blatantly rigging it to a low bar is an admission by Mueller and his team that their case is too weak for prime time. Even now Manafort is suing the DOJ. His lawsuit may go nowhere, but the odds are good that Muellers tactics and evidence wont stand up to serious scrutiny. Thats what happened with key Mueller team member Andrew Weissmanns assault on Arthur Andersen.",1
"Title: Muslim Militia Leader Abu Khattala Gets 22-Year Sentence In Benghazi Jihad Attacks That Killed US Ambassador & 3 Other Americans  Article: On Wednesday, a Libyan militia leader, who was convicted of the deadly attacks in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, which resulted in the deaths of a US ambassador and three other Americans, was sentenced to 22 years in Washington, DC by a federal judge. The obvious question for those paying attention to American politics, or propaganda, at the time was that the Obama administration went out of their way to deceive the American people about the attack, claiming that it was the result of some Muslims who were upset about a video that was actually produced by a Muslim, not a Coptic Christian, who was an agent of former Attorney General Eric Holder. We know the YouTube video was irrelevant and it was, in fact, an Islamic jihad attack that apparently involved former Muslim Brotherhood Egyptian President Morsi. take our poll - story continues below  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

"Title: Mortician arrested after spending 8 hours with penis stuck inside corpse  Article: A mortician from Savannah, in Georgia, was arrested this morning after his penis got stuck inside a dead mans rectum, causing him to get caught several hours later. 67-year old Alfred Mortimer Evans was laying on the body of a 47-year old car accident victim when his colleagues arrived this morning and he was visibly stuck in this awkward position. He immediately admitted that he had been in this position for several hours and asked his co-workers for help. Unfortunately for him, his colleagues were unable to help him and they had to call the emergency services. Joey Dunmore, one of the paramedics who was called on the site, described the scene in an interview with the Savannah Daily Herald. He was laying on top of the corpse with his pants around his knees. He didnt really seem to feel any pain, but he was obviously humiliated. It took paramedics more than an hour before they could free him, and he was then immediately arrested by officers of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department. 17 criminal charges have been filed against Alfred Evans, including indecent treatment of a corpse, disorderly conduct, indecent exposure and possession of illegal drugs. Since the accused has worked on the night shift at the Chatham County Morgue for 43 years, and the investigators believe he could have sexually abused several other corpses in the past, and they expect to file more charges over the next few days.

"Title: Fellowship of the Minds  Article: Obama is going out with a determination to inflict as much possible terror on America as possible. From Daily Mail: President Obama is planning to transfer at least 22 additional Guantanamo Bay detainees out of the military detention center before he leaves office later this month, DailyMail.com has learned. The group being released will be drawn from those held at Guantanamo  who include an accused senior al Qaeda bomb-maker, the terror groups top financial manager, and two intended 9/11 hijackers, who have all been held in the Cuba-based U.S. detention facility for more than a decade. According to a military source briefed on the process, 22 detainees are being prepared for transfer out of the camp, also known as Gitmo, before January 20. Although the White House has not specified which inmates will be transferred out  or which foreign countries have agreed to accept them  it has indicated that this will be a priority for Obama in his final days in office. I cant speak to any individual notifications that have been made to Congress or give you a specific preview about upcoming transfers, said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. I think I would expect at this point additional transfers to be announced before January 20th. Obama will likely focus on moving the 23 detainees who have been cleared for transfer  a group that includes the alleged head of al Qaedas bomb-manufacturing operation in eastern Afghanistan, the head of al Qaedas Tunisian faction in Afghanistan, and senior weapons trainers. Those held in Guantanamo in recent years have been dubbed the worst of the worst by military and intelligence officials.",1
"Title: Tensions high as protesters in San Francisco fight back against Patriot Prayer rally that didnt happen  Article: Last Saturday, the big news wasnt a right-wing rally in Boston that attracted a handful of people; it was the counter-protest, which the mayor estimated at some 40,000 people, some of whom decided to throw rocks and bottles of urine at cops since there were no Nazis about to punch.

"Title: Dean Baker: 'Welcome to the Second Great Depression'  Article: The piece speaks for itself, and in the clear layperson-friendly language that characterizes Baker's work. He points out that the reason the economic downturn in the thirties became what we now call is the Great Depression, was mass unemployment; to be more precise, it was the political failure to respond to mass unemployment due to a dangerous and misplaced concern about budget deficits - sound familiar? Unfortunately, the country seems destined to follow the same course in the current slump as it did in the 30s. The May jobs report should have provided the sort of stiff kick that is needed to revive discussion of additional stimulus. Instead, it seems to have barely shaken Washingtons ongoing obsession with deficits. He points out that a poor labor market amounts to not only fewer jobs but also less income because workers don't have the bargaining power to demand better wages. The horrid labor market, plus the $7 trillion (and ongoing) deflation of the housing bubble, is limiting consumption, which accounts for 70 percent of demand in the economy. In theory, he says, relief could come in the form of trade generated by massive increase in demand from trading partners, but they're also suffering economically. That leaves government. With these other sectors accounted for, this leaves the government as the only remaining candidate for boosting the economy. But additional stimulus is not even on the agenda in Washington. Instead, we are seeing cutbacks at all levels of government. These cutbacks led to a loss of 29,000 jobs in May.",1
"Title: New research suggests fracking is probably poisoning the air  Article: Trees may be brown because of the seasons, not the air quality Trees may be brown because of the seasons, not the air quality The researchers found that hydraulic fracturing -- a technique for releasing natural gas from below-ground rock formations -- emits pollutants known as PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), including some that are linked with increased risk of cancer and respiratory ailments. ""Air pollution from fracking operations may pose an under-recognized health hazard to people living near them,"" said the study's coauthor Kim Anderson, an environmental chemist with OSU's College of Agricultural Sciences. Haynes got in touch with Anderson and Kincl, and together they designed the study to include citizen participation. They placed air samplers on the properties of 23 volunteers living or working at sites ranging from right next to a gas well to a little more than three miles away. The samplers picked up high levels of PAHs across the study area. Levels were highest closest to the wells and decreased by about 30 percent with distance. Even the lowest levels -- detected on sites more than a mile away from a well -- were higher than previous researchers had found in downtown Chicago and near a Belgian oil refinery. They were about 10 times higher than in a rural Michigan area with no natural gas wells. The team also accounted for the influences of wood smoke and vehicle exhaust, common sources of airborne pyrogenic PAHs. Wood smoke was consistent across the sampling area, supporting the conclusion that the gas wells were contributing to the higher PAH levels.",0
"Title: Soros Buying San Diego DA Race  Article: Leftist billionaire George Soros is injecting big money into a San Diego district attorney race as part of his larger effort to install extremist prosecutors across America who will refuse to enforce inconvenient laws that liberals and progressives dont like. Soros, who turns 88 in August, has been underwriting district attorney races across America in an effort to dismantle the criminal justice system, empty the prisons, and sabotage the enforcement of immigration laws. Soros supports state and local efforts to resist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and wants to cripple police in order to advance the neo-Marxist abstraction known as social justice that simplistically breaks the world down into race, class, and sex or gender. Radicals claim that American laws and institutions are inherently corrupt and that these systems protect, for example, wealthy, white, native-born, non-disabled males at the expense of everyone else. Getting people who share Soross worldview into public office at every level is key to promoting his ugly vision of how America, which he calls the main obstacle to a stable and just world order, should look. Months ago Soros saturation-bombed his Open Society Foundations philanthropy with an $18 billion donation, likely guaranteeing OSF will remain one of the most important players in left-wing activism for decades to come. According to the New York Times, this was one of the largest transfers of wealth ever made by a private donor to a single foundation.

"Title: Will we bomb Iran for the women?  Article: The American war party continues to itch for an excuse to make war on Iran and has now dusted off an old playbook in its latest effort to get one started. The plan is simple. Foment a seemingly organic round of protests. Create a cause that will pluck at American heartstrings. Use chaos agents, bad actors, agents provocateur and operatives to either instigate violence from the state security apparatus or use violence and procured weapons to make it appear the state security apparatus has begun violent repression. Then employ American media to use video to transmit compelling images relating to the chosen cause and detailing the violent oppressive actions. Sit back and wait for Americans to clamor for government to do something. It worked in Libya, Syria and Ukraine. Will it work in Iran? While the Iran protests that began in the waning days of December seemed to be dying down in recent days, the protest movement may gain some stream today after Friday prayers. These so-called revolutions are pre-planned actions by globalist institutions like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institute, the neocon think tank funded by fascist globalist corporations. In the CFR-linked Project for a New American Century, the war party outlined its plans for manipulating actions in the Middle East and bringing down the regimes in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Iran  among others  and installing puppet regimes back in 2000. Its the blueprint George Bush the lesser used to blow up Iraq as part of the so-called War on Terror, a blueprint in place even before 9/11 occurred, as General Wesley Clark revealed.",0
"Title: A Good Leak  Article: Last weekend, the FBI arrested an employee of a corporation in Augusta, Georgia, that had a contract with the National Security Agency and charged her with espionage. Espionage occurs when someone who has been entrusted to safeguard state secrets fails to do so. In this case, the government alleges that the person to whom state secrets had been entrusted is 25-year-old Reality Leigh Winner, who had a top-secret national security clearance. The government claims that Winner downloaded and printed a top-secret NSA report, removed the printed version of the report from her employers premises, and then mailed it to The Intercept, a highly regarded international media outlet that exposes government wrongdoing. The government says it learned of this when folks from The Intercept called the NSA and told agents what they had received and what they planned to publish. After hearing agents describe the potential harm to their work if the full report were to be released, The Intercept agreed to redact certain portions, though it published the bulk of the report. Time to buy old US gold coins The report is startling, as it reveals that the NSA discovered that Russian hackers in late October and early November 2016 planted cookies (attractive, uniquely tailored links) into the websites of 122 American city and county clerks responsible for counting ballots in the The Constitution in Ex...

"Title: Nigerian Pedophile Denaturalized And DeportedMSM: Sex Offender From Grand Prairie"" | Blog Posts  Article: The Dallas News headline is In a move once reserved for Nazis, sex offender from Grand Prairie loses citizenship and gets deported. But he cant be from Grand Prairie, if hes being deported, he has to be from somewhere else, that theyre deporting him to. It turns out that the answer to what inquiring minds want to know is he's a Nigerian pedophile, something that could easily go in the headline. Emmanuel Olugbenga Omopariola, 61, was convicted of indecency with a 7-year-old girl, an offense committed before he was naturalized, according to federal officials and federal court papers. He was deported back to Nigeria on Thursday, under escort from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. This deportation ends this U.S. chapter for Omopariola who sabotaged his own future and opportunities through his heinous crimes against a child, and his lies on his naturalization application and in interviews, said Simona L. Flores, field office director for removal operations for ICE in the Dallas region. The point about ""a move once reserved for Nazis"" is that the US government pursued a policy of denaturalizing anyone who could be shown to have lied on his immigration papers. Ann Coulter, discussing the number of undeported radical Muslims, et cetera wrote last year that  To this day, we have a whole office at the Department of Justice dedicated to finding and deporting Nazis even without proof they personally committed crimes against Jews. But they could only do this because the Government always asks new citizens to swear that they weren't Nazis before naturalizing them.",1
"Title: Millions of America's Gun Nuts Aren't Hiding Their Yearning for Civil War %%  Article: This country is in trouble; not the sequester or the debt ceiling or closing down the country. The Fed and Congress can reverse those issues in a finger snap. Our trouble is coming from the barrel of a gun from rabid paranoids and the people on the take. Include also, terrified legislators staring down that barrel from clever manipulators like Karl Rove, in the employ of filthy rich maggots with no conscience. The farce that is the congressional reaction to the Sandy Hook Bushmaster Childrens Slaughter (BCS) continues unabated. A Senate Judiciary Panel was holding a February 27 hearing on a bill laughingly described as an assault weapons ban (with a mere 2,200 exceptions). Before them was a tearful construction worker Neil Heslin. Hes the father of 1 of the 20 BCS child victims, cherubic, six-year-old Jesse Lewis Heslin. He held up a framed photo portrait of Jesse sitting on his dads lap, the picture the very quintessence of a loving parent-child relationship. Neither the grieving parent or the portrait seemed to emotionally change a single expression or mind of the right-wing gun worshiping members of the panel. Most of whom were wondering which fancy restaurant the gun lobbyists would spring for after the ordeal of hearing yet another sob story was over. Heslin had also appeared as one of numerous invitees to a series of General Assembly Task Force hearings held in several rooms of the Legislative Office Building about five weeks prior to the Senate Judiciary Panel. An estimated 1,500 NRA gun nuts were out in force. Some of them split off into the room where Heslin was testifying.",1
"Title: How is Trump Supposed To Negotiate Immigration When His Opponents Are Constantly Calling Him A ""Racist""?  Article: Once upon a time, it wasnt okay to smear your political opponent with something like racist or bigot without first showing some evidence. Sadly, in todays America, these words get thrown around as if they have no meaning and as if everyone can agree to their usage. The latest example comes to us through the immigration debate where the left and the media continue to attack the President for supposedly calling some 3rd world nation(s) sh**holes, something the President denies ever saying (and several of the people in the meeting have backed him up on this point). Heres the problem, while the Presidents language may be vulgar and his word choice poor, its a sentiment that most Americans agree with, and its at the heart of a larger debate about how we choose migrants to accept into our nation. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) made a similar argument while defending the President from his detractors, on NBCs Meet the Press when he asked how the President is supposed to negotiate on DACA and illegal immigration if his opponents are all calling him a racist. Its as if the left doesnt actually want to negotiate a compromise, they simply want to smear the President and make compromise impossible. Rand Paul: I dont think the comments were constructive at all. But I also think that to be fair, we shouldnt draw conclusions that he didnt intend. I know personally about his feelings towards Haiti and towards Central America because when I was not a candidate for president and he wasnt a candidate for president, I went down there on a medical mission trip. I did about 200 cataract surgeries with a group of surgeons in Haiti and the same in Central America.",1

Bernie Sanders, Michael Moore and Elizabeth Warren, three lefty millionaires, got together to solve ""income inequality"" in a town hall broadcast live from the Capitol visitors center. Washington D.C., where two out of the three parasites do business, has the worst income inequality in the country. The bottom fifth of Washington D.C. account for just 2% of the citys income.

It isnt any of their usual villains, the corporations and banks, who made Washington D.C. so miserable. Its the triumph of socialism. Washington D.C. and its bedroom communities are what the entire country would look like if the left got its way. A socialist apartheid state divided between the business of government and the poor.

And the fact is that the late, great American Conservative Movement used to be like this. I'm old enough to remember. I emigrated to it in 1970. This is how it used to be. At one point at Forbes, I used to interview every year Milton Friedman, the great free market economist, who was actually also a great man. (Although I realize that he has critics here, Tom! [Piataksee here]) And he once said to me, in the mid-nineties, that it was to his great surprise late in his long lifeand he was 94 when he diedthat he had suddenly started to meet stupid libertariansstupid free market economists.",0
