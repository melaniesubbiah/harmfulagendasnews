"Title: More women than ever are freezing their eggs while waiting for Mr. Right  Article: NewsBioethics LEICESTER, England, September 13, 2016 (LifeSiteNews)  Statistics show that women are delaying both marriage and having children, with a rapidly increasing number of women freezing their own eggs in hopes of having baby in the intentionally distant future. There are a variety of reasons for this in modern times, led by the ""climb the career ladder"" feminist culture that downplays domesticity and devalues motherhood. But The Daily Mail has found that the reason more women are freezing their eggs is because they haven't found the right father for their children-to-be. Researcher Kylie Baldwin, a Ph.D student at De Montfort University, surveyed 31 women who have frozen their ova and discovered the women are actually waiting for a ""hands-on"" father. ""It was the absence of this particular type of potential father, not just the absence of any partner, that led them to freeze the eggs,"" she told The Daily Mail. ""It's about having the right dad for their child. "" ""None of the women underwent the procedure for career reasons,"" Baldwin explained. Instead, many aggressively pursued their career precisely because they had not found a fatherly man who was as committed to parenthood as they wanted him to be. Several women surveyed were in relationships with partners that satisfied them personally but weren't ""father material,"" so they froze their eggs while remaining in the sexually satisfying relationship in the hope that a better man would enter their lives. Freezing ova for later fertilization was first offered to cancer patients whose treatment caused permanent sterility to allow them to have children after treatment.",0

"Title: Why JPMorgan Believes Central Banks Can No Longer Save The Day  Article: In recent weeks, JPMorgan has turned decidedly sour on the US equity market: one month ago, on March 3, JPM announced that ""for the first time this cycle"", it has gone underweight stocks. Equities, credit and commodities have all rallied in the last three weeks, as some of the immediate threats to the world economy have faded from attention, possibly only because the bad earnings season has wound up. But, to us, the fundamentals of growth, earnings and recession risk have not improved, and if anything have worsened. We remain wary of the near-empty ammo box of policy makers. Our 12-month-out US recession odds have risen to 1/3, while equity-implied odds have instead fallen to near 1/5. But even with no recession this year or next, we see US earnings rising only slowly by low single digits and see little to boost multiples. The eventual recession should bring US stocks down some 30%, creating a strong downward risk skew to returns over the next few years. We use the rally in stocks to sell it and go underweight stocks, versus HG corporate bonds and cash. The strong rebound of the past few weeks does create near-term momentum, and thus keeps our first UW small. To be sure, the continued bounce since the JPM call has not been exactly reassuring of the forecast's accuracy. However, what is surprising is that when faced with unpalatable price action, sellside researchers usually flip their call quickly. Not in this case, because in a surprisingly candid piece released overnight, JPM's Jan Loeys doubles down, and after asking rhetorically ""Can central banks really save the day, or cycle? "", his answer is no.",0
"Title: Celebrities To Leave US After Election of Racist, Sexist, Islamophobic, and Anti-Semitic Trump!  Article: By Ivan Fernando On November 8th everything changed. Americans voted to entirely repudiate the legacy of our first African-American President, Barack Hussein Obama, and to elect racist, sexist, bigoted, dangerous pathological narcissist Donald J. Trump, as President of the United States of America. My eyes are filled with tears as I write this and my heart is filled with sorrow. In times like this, I ask myself, is life worth living? Like so many progressives, I even contemplated throwing away my own life on that fateful night. Words cannot begin to express the pain, the hopelessness, and the fear, that progressives all around the world are feeling right now, as we tremble dreading the future. In response to this unacceptable outrage, progressives are demanding that this offensive election outcome be overturned in the name of preserving Americas Democracy! Of course, that is very unlikely to happen. Tragically, and inexplicably, Hillary Clinton has conceded the election to Trump, and President Obama has even invited the racist beast to the White House. Americans may think that they can vote for whoever they want, however they will pay a very serious price when they choose to vote for racist, sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic, and anti-Semitic candidates! A very serious price indeed, I assure you! A group of Americas most talented celebrities, including actors and musicians have joined together to form the Not Our Country Anymore Committee. Their purpose is to find an acceptable new country or countries for Americas most brilliant and talented celebrities. America has shown that it is a racist and backward country.",0
"Title: Fmr. Congressman and Korean War Vet Calls for End of the War in Iraq  Article: ""As a partially disabled army veteran myself, I know what it's like to answer the call of duty and that service in the military can have serious personal consequences."" Shamansky said. ""On this Memorial Day, we must ask whether the time has come to pull American troops out of Iraq and bring them home. The question is not whether or not we should have gone to war with Iraq in the first place. The question is what do we do now? "" Shamansky took on the Bush administration for criticizing those who question the president's agenda; ""The Bush administration says we must ""stay the course"" and that ""when the Iraqis stand up, we can stand down... The President is asking for an open-ended commitment of American lives and American money ---for a vaguely defined outcome of a ""Democratic Iraq. "" The mothers that spoke with Shamansky both gave emotional speeches, talking about the frustration of having their sons being sent to fight in a misguided war. The mothers included Mona Parsons, who's son is currently in Iraq as part of the Army's 101st Airborne, and Teresa Dawson, mother of Spc. Christopher Stentz an Ohio National Guardsman who recently returned from a tour in Iraq. Dawson said that she had always felt that this war was misguided and wrong. ""If we'd have paid attention to the Generals and the Pentagon we'd have known that this war was bound for failure... Now we need to admit we were wrong and bring the troops home. "" ""As the daughter of a Marine, the mother of a Guardsman who recently returned from a year in Iraq and as an Ohio University graduate who has studied the American Justice system-what I value the most about America, is our freedom of speech.",0

Personal Liberty Digest presents: The WIRE! Law enforcement announced this week that they had raided a New Mexico compound in which starving children were being tortured into becoming potential school shooters. Oddly, almost none of the media seemed interested in reporting the religious motivations of the monster who ran the place  who has been linked to known Islamofascists and terrorist accomplices like Siraj Wahhaj and Linda Sarsour. Hint: not Quaker. Authorities also announced charges against a previously deported illegal immigrant from Honduras who raped a child after being released by the city of Philadelphia, in keeping with Phillys sanctuary city policy. Got one of your groovy little dances for this one, Mayor Kenney? Across town in Philly, conservative activists Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens were assaulted by yet another Democrat-incited mob. Welcome to the City of Brotherly Shove. Liberals were overjoyed when multiple social media and communications companies barred Alex Jones and his site InfoWars from their platforms over his tendency to push lies and conspiracy theories.

"Title: Sarah Palin's Approval Rating Hits a New All Time Low %%  Article: As Sarah Palin basks in both the cash of, and the love from the Tea Party, a new Washington Post poll reveals that her political popularity among the nation as a whole has never been lower. Conservative Republicans give her a 71% approval rating and tea partiers put her at 60%, but the nation as a whole gives her only a 37% approval rating, and a 55% disapproval rating. The most striking number from the Washington Post poll was that only 17% of all Americans surveyed said that they held a strongly favorable view of the former Alaska governor. In contrast, 41% of respondents strongly disapproved of her. Palins rating with Independents mirrors her overall 37%-55% approval/disapproval rating. Her favorability rating gains one point with Independents to 38%, while her disapproval rating holds steady at 55%. Palin is popular with the Tea Party crowd, as she has a 60% approval rating with them, but the Tea Party as a whole is more popular than Palin herself. With all adults surveyed the Tea Party has a 41% approval rating. Although the gap is small, it is possible that Palins lack of personal popularity could end up damaging the Tea Party movement in the eyes of the nation at large. The Tea Party movement, even with its recent run of negative publicity, remains more popular than Sarah Palin. Palins approval ratings have remained in steady decline since October of 2008. Her book didnt help. Her gig at Fox News has not helped, and it is safe to say that a reality show on the Discovery Channel is not going to revive the flat lined national political perception of her.",0
"Title: Muslim Militia Leader Abu Khattala Gets 22-Year Sentence In Benghazi Jihad Attacks That Killed US Ambassador & 3 Other Americans  Article: On Wednesday, a Libyan militia leader, who was convicted of the deadly attacks in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, which resulted in the deaths of a US ambassador and three other Americans, was sentenced to 22 years in Washington, DC by a federal judge. The obvious question for those paying attention to American politics, or propaganda, at the time was that the Obama administration went out of their way to deceive the American people about the attack, claiming that it was the result of some Muslims who were upset about a video that was actually produced by a Muslim, not a Coptic Christian, who was an agent of former Attorney General Eric Holder. We know the YouTube video was irrelevant and it was, in fact, an Islamic jihad attack that apparently involved former Muslim Brotherhood Egyptian President Morsi. take our poll - story continues below  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

"Title: Steve Bannon Is Stepping Down From Breitbart  Article: Just days after President Trump snubbed an olive branch offered by his former chief strategist and putative ""alter-ego"", the New York Times is reporting that Steve Bannon - the ""alt-right"" icon and former Trump campaign manager - is stepping down from his position as executive chairman of Breitbart News. Trump blasted Bannon in a public statement last week, saying the former senior White House official and - briefly - member of the National Security Council - ""lost his mind"" after Trump fired him. Bannon and the president had an abrupt falling out last week after excerpts from Michael Wolff's controversial book ""Fire And Fury"" - his account of the first year of the Trump administration - revealed Bannon making several embarrassing on-the-record statements. In one, he said Don. Jr.'s decision to organize the Russia meeting was ""treasonous"", and that President Trump definitely knew about the meeting. In another, he reportedly told Wolff that the possibility of removing Trump via the 25th amendment is discussed daily in the West Wing. Breitbart published a terse statement about Bannon's departure on its website. It was stocked with several wooden platitudes from CEO Larry Solov: Stephen K. Bannon has stepped down from Breitbart News Network, where he served as Executive Chairman since 2012. Bannon and Breitbart will work together on a smooth and orderly transition. Bannon said, Im proud of what the Breitbart team has accomplished in so short a period of time in building out a world-class news platform.",0
"Title: WHO Prepares For Worst Case As Congo Ebola Outbreak Spreads  Article: This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge  In the week since we first noted the new outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the number of cases has risen by 50%, and The World Health Organization has now said it is preparing for the worst case scenario. The WHO has tallied 32 suspected or confirmed cases in the northwestern area of Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumbathe near the border with the Republic of Congo, including 18 deaths, between April 4 and May 9. The outbreak, declared by the DRC health ministry on Tuesday, is the DRCs ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976,when the deadly viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team. Scientists are greatly concerned that this outbreak in the remote Bikoro region will travel 175 miles to the city of Mbandaka  the capital of Equateur province and home to around 1.2 million residents. Weve updated this map. Turns out that the provincial capital of Equateur, Mbandaka, is home to roughly 1M people. Its less than 300 km or 175 miles from Bikoro and reachable by water. pic.twitter.com/3Q3PwAAdsh  Helen Branswell (@HelenBranswell) May 11, 2018  Whats worrisome is that the most recent WHO update says that there are two probable cases at Wangata  which is very close to Mbandaka. #EbolaDRC: This news gives me pause. @WHOs latest update says there are 2 probable cases at Wangata, which is adjacent to the provincial capital, Mbandaka.

"Title: CBC put its anti-Catholic bigotry on display in pro-gay attack on school board chair: critic  Article: NewsCatholic Church, Homosexuality TORONTO, December 14, 2015 (LifeSiteNews)  The CBC recently targeted the chair of Torontos Catholic District School Board for refusing to state that gay-straight alliances belong in Catholic schools. But pro-family advocates laud Angela Kennedy for her defiance in the face of an anti-Catholic agenda, and point out that Catholics have a constitutional right to teach their faith in the Ontarios publicly-funded Catholic schools. On December 2, CBCs Metro Morning host Matt Galloway repeatedly grilled Kennedy, a 15-year veteran trustee who on November 30 was acclaimed TCDSB chair, about whether gay-straight alliances belong in Catholic schools. And Kennedy repeatedly replied that Catholic schools have supportive clubs and a mental health strategy for students. Galloway pointedly noted that Kennedy avoided the term gay-straight alliance, and that she refused to confirm that such clubs belong in Catholic schools. He led off the segment by stating that Kennedy had opposed GSAs in the past. Kudos for her, was the response of Campaign Life Coalitions Jack Fonseca. By not saying gay-straight alliance, what she was saying was, no, of course not, they dont belong in Catholic schools, he told LifeSiteNews. The question posed to Kennedy was idiotic, Fonseca added. Why would you ask a faithful Catholic whether gay pride clubs belong in a Catholic religious school? Clearly, it was a dishonest question.",1

"Title: Mysterious elongated Skull discovered in Russia recreated in 3D  Article: Russian archaeologists have managed to recreate a computer model of the enigmatic elongated skull that was discovered in Russias Stonehenge: Arkaim. This proves that elongated skulls are a global phenomenon present all around the world. The question that remains is: Why were elongated skulls so important in the distant past? In 2015, Russian archaeologists excavating Russias Stonehenge known as Arkaim discovered a mysterious skeleton with an unusually anomalous elongated skull. After numerous studies and analysis, they have managed to recreate how the Arkaim elongated skull really looked like in the distant past. Arkaim is one of the most mysterious ancient archaeological sites in Russia. This 20.000 square meter compound was protected by circular walls just before it was burned down and abandoned mysteriously. Archaeologists believe that, just like Stonehenge in the UK, Arkaim was an ancient site dedicated to the observation of stars and constellations. Arkaim was a very sophisticated settlement, and in some cases, it displayed unique technologies that went far beyond the capabilities of other similar settlements since Arkaim had a very complex water drainage system and sedimentation pits. Researchers speculate that ancient tribes in the vicinity of Arkaim practiced head binding just as many other ancient cultures around the globe. Researcher Maria Makurova has confirmed to the Russian news agency TASS: We have found a well-preserved skeleton. Her skull was elongated because the tribe did so by tying up the heads of their children with rope.",0
"Title: Is It Kumbaya Or Is It The Calm Before The Storm?  Article: What is clear to even the most ill-informed citizen is that things are not good in Washington. While our Founding Fathers purposefully created a governmental structure of checks and balances, they didn't intend for it to be a government of inaction. Nor did they foresee a government composed of professional politicians who need to spend the bulk of their time raising funds and campaigning for reelection. Obviously, this reality impacts on the way in which members of congress react and act on any given issue. This is to say that often instead of acting in the interests of their constituents, they act in the interests of those who fund their campaigns, enabling them to successfully run for reelection. Certainly, this reality should come as no surprise to anyone who has been following this year's campaigns. What is also clear is that at times the interests of the political funders are at odds with the interests of the country and even the local constituents. This is obviously not surprising either. However, if we accept these two realities as fact, we acknowledge that we no longer have representative government. In fact, if only those who are funded by the rich, or those who have personal wealth can afford to run for office, we have moved to a plutocracy. It obviously gives incredible power to the likes of the Koch Brothers. It seems that this election, as others in the recent past, has illustrated the damage that money has done to our system of government. The Citizens United Supreme Court ruling and the unapologetic attitude of those who fund these elections has created a serious challenge to representative democracy.",0
"Title: Pro-Russian activists in Ukraine vow to press on with referendum on May 11  Article: Dmitry Babich told VoR: There are three days left before May 11, the preliminary date for the referendum. Since questions have not been formulated, I dont see how you can prepare bulletins in such short period of time. Basically what Vladimir Putin said was the acknowledgement of the situation on the ground but to a certain extent it was also a compromise. Mr Putin said that Ukraine is not in the state right now to hold referendums or presidential elections, even though he called the idea of having presidential elections a step in the right direction. I would not say that people in the east of Ukraine are just going to blindly follow what Mr Putin says. After all we should not forget that these people [insurgents] are dying. They lost 30 people after the artillery barrage yesterday in Slavyansk. And they are not going to change their decisions just because the president of a neighbouring country said something.  Dmitry Shibalov/ Ostrov Vladimir Putins position is pretty moderate and certainly he doesnt deserve derogatory definitions that were given to him by Mr Hague. On the other hand, Mr Putin made it clear that a presidential election in May would not be fair. You cant have a real presidential election in a country where 40 people were burned alive in one of the cities and where you have military action with the use of airplanes and tanks in another region. The confrontation inside the Ukrainian society is so great and the choice of candidates is so poor. The ones that have real chances are Yulia Tymoshenko and Petr Poroshenko  their views are not very different from each other. Certainly they will not suit the east or the south of Ukraine.",1
"Title: Catholic schools legal battle continues over dismissal of former counselor, coach in gay marriage  Article: NewsCatholic Church, Homosexuality JERSEY CITY, New Jersey, December 21, 2016 (LifeSiteNews)  The discrimination lawsuit filed by a former New Jersey Catholic high school employee fired for entering into a homosexual marriage will move forward after a state appeals court declined review of a superior court decision allowing the suit to progress. Kate Drumgoole sued Paramus Catholic High School and the Archdiocese of Newark in April, claiming her dismissal last January violated the states anti-discrimination law and intentionally inflicted emotional distress. Drumgoole was fired as dean of guidance and head girls basketball coach after administrators learned she was married to another woman, which the school conceded in court last August, arguing it did not violate discrimination law because of the expectation for employees to abide by Catholic Church teaching. ""She was terminated for violating the Ministerial Policies and the Code of Ethics  in failing to abide by the tenets of the Roman Catholic faith, i.e. by entering into a same-sex marriage,"" the schools motion had said. Additionally, Drumgoole had signed an agreement more than once since she was hired to follow the Roman Catholic Churchs tenets, which was part of her collective bargaining contract. The superior court judge had ruled that further discovery was warranted, saying in particular the court must look at whether Drumgoole had worked in a ministerial capacity and therefore whether the dispute is secular or ecclesiastical.",0
"Title: John Oliver: The Confederate Flag Helps Us Identify the Worst People in the World %%  Article: John Oliver called it out on Last Week Tonight, saying that the Confederate flag is one of those symbols that should only be used to help us identify the worst people in the world. Watch the clip from Sundays show here: While the American flag was flying at half-staff on the South Carolina capitol building after the terrorist attack that killed nine people in a place of worship, Oliver explained, The one thing especially appalling  the Confederate battle flag was flying at full staff in front of the state capitol. The bigger question is why is it flying at any staff at all. In for the truth shot, Oliver added, The Confederate flag is one of those symbols that should really only be seen on T-shirts, belt buckles, and bumper stickers to help the rest of us identify the worst people in the world. If youre not from the south or havent lived there for a long time, the clip of South Carolina Senator and Republican presidential candidate Lindsey Graham explaining that the Confederate flag is who we are might shock you. Graham begrudgingly admitted  in that southern drawl that says this is ugly, and we shouldnt talk about it  that the flag has sometimes been used in a racist way. Sometimes, yall. Oliver wasnt having any of that, and he pointed out, I believe the first time the Confederate flag was used in a racist way was the exact second they finished sewing the first one! It was around that time! But really, this is the point. This is what people need to realize, especially in light of the Supreme Court saying that we dont need voter protection in the South anymore.

"Title: There Has to Be Room for Dissent Among Obama Supporters %%  Article: Theres a true story in my husbands family passed along to teach everyone a valuable lesson. His grandfather was an eccentric man who loved to gamble, his game of choice being poker. One day, he placed an outlandish bet. He put up his house. As it happens, his bluff was called, and he lost his house. But it didnt really matter if he had won. He put something on the table that didnt belong in the game. Its not like a partial cut to Social Security proposed by the President is the equivalent to giving up your entire home. However, the moral of the story is that like the house, even if youre holding an excellent hand, some things dont belong in the game, because the stakes are too high. Everyone has their sacred cows, and for many who have watched Republicans throughout their entire lives try to find some foothold into dismantling Social Security, creating a precedent where this program could be cut was one of them. We have yet to see what will happen in the fiscal negotiations, but in the meantime, there are strained relationships among liberals outside the beltway. Some have seen fit to name call, label, and denigrate anyone who disagrees with the President. In a strong democracy, reasonable criticisms of the President or other elected officials have to be considered healthy and necessary, without stigma and condemnation raining down on those who make them. There are at least two ways to criticize a President. One way I will call bagging based on the language thats already been popularized. Bagging can be defined as relentless criticism of elected officials with a simultaneous inability to recognize any of their positive contributions.",0
"Title: No Doubt About It, I Will Vote For Hillary Clinton If  Article: she wins the primary. Will I be happy, no, but I'm not going to commit stupidity and vote Republican. Up until that point I will support and donate to Bernie Sanders. I see no point in attacking Hillary Clinton, as giving the right more drool fuel than they already have is just plain nuts. If Clinton wins the primary the hate, misogyny and toxicity on show will be truly appalling. Hell I'm not even a Democrat [never will be either] but it has been a fact that for at least the last 60 years that the Republicans make handling plutonium safe by comparison. Also I really don't like the bipartisan center as that operates for one group of people alone, the extremely wealthy and coddles within it the warmongers. I don't like the two party first past the post system, but are we going to change that anytime soon? I don't like the corruption and favors linked to how campaigns are financed, it distorts further an already distorted system. Personally I can live with President Obama's policies and by the same logic Hillary Clinton's. I may not like the policies, I may disagree loudly and in my opinion they are too easily dragged to right of the great divide, but to even think of allowing another Republican jackass into the White House just makes me want to vomit. I have said for a long time that if you want to change the Democratic Party you have to do it from the ground up. That is one of the reasons I support Bernie Sanders 100% as to me this is a sign of a shift in the debate. Elizabeth Warren another.

"Title: The Trump Investigation and the Libyan War  Article: The Libyan War may have been Hillary's biggest scandal. It's also the scandal that hardly anyone talks about. After the murder of three Americans in Benghazi, conservative interest largely narrowed down to that particular incident rather than the larger context of the illegal war. But now it looks like the investigation of the Trump investigation is headed toward Libya,  In the heavily redacted, declassified version of the letter, which outlined why Graham and Grassley asked the Justice Department to consider opening a criminal investigation into Steeles communications with the FBI, the senators allege that Clinton associates were feeding Mr. Steele accusations against the Trump campaign, thereby calling into question Steeles credibility as a neutral source. Two sources familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, told me the redacted portions of the letter refer to the information compiled by Shearerfor the first time revealing some of the key details that were redacted in the original letter. Shearers information was passed to Steele by Winer. Winer, a friend of Steeles, was then serving as the special envoy for Libya, and had previously passed Steeles Russia and Ukraine reports along to the State Departments Europe bureau between 2014 and 2016... According to a source familiar with the matter, however, Steeles memorandum was actually a handwritten note on a copy of Shearers report that outlined its originthe foreign sub-source who had been in touch with Shearer.

"Title: The Vatican is Coming After Humanae Vitae: Time to Fight Back  Article: The memorandum states that the commission is to promote a comprehensive and authoritative study of the encyclical to coincide with its fiftieth anniversary this summer. Mr. Pentin then goes on to give observations of the theological bent of the commissions four members which is less than encouraging. On September 11, 2017 Edward Pentin penned an article for the National Catholic Register entitled,  Humanae Vitae Comes Under Fire . In that article he stated, that recent developments in Rome indicate a campaign is underway to challenge the encyclicals prohibition against artificial contraception. Evidence includes the revealing of a formerly secret commission tasked by the Vatican, with the Popes approval, to study Humanae Vitae. The commission was discovered only through an Italian website obtaining a classified memorandum from the Vatican Secretary of State referring to it. Mr. Pentin writes:  Before his death on Sept. 6, Cardinal Carlo Caffarra had privately expressed similar grave concerns about the commission. Like others, he believed the opening of the archives was a ploy to obtain selected findings and then present them to show that Paul VIs commission was moving in the direction of loosening the Churchs teaching on contraception, but undue pressure was placed on the Pope to reassert the doctrine. Another expected strategy by commission members and other revisionists is to present any re-interpretations as part of a change in paradigm in moral theology, just as was achieved with Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love) in allowing for some civilly remarried divorcees to receive Holy Communion.",0

"Title: HALF of Americans Die Broke! Pension Funds are GONE!  Article: HALF of Americans Die Broke! Pension Funds are GONE! Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! Its not just the government which has found itself in unpayable amounts of debt. The people of the U.S. have been following suit. Looking around the world we see that most people encountering the same mess. Even cultures who typically dont use debt and mortgages, have expanded into these ways in recent years. Theres no turning back. Why are pensions disappearing? Wiatrowski points to risk. Private companies want to take on less risk when helping to provide for their employees retirement. Its why these companies are ever more frequently turning to defined contribution plans  such as 401(k) plans  in which employees typically fund most of their own retirement by automatically setting aside money from each paycheck. This differs from traditional defined benefit pension plans, in which employers promise to provide their workers a specific monthly payout once they retire. In a defined benefit pension plan, the risk of retirement funding falls on employers, Wiatrowski says. Employers must provide the benefits theyve promised employees no matter if the company is struggling or if its made poor investments. This isnt the case with defined contribution plans. In defined contribution plans, the risk falls to the employees, Wiatrowski says. The employer might match some or all of their employees savings, but they still know that each month or once a year theyll have to put in X amount of dollars. Their commitment is a fixed amount.",0
"Title: Bright kids shouldnt be dulled down with drugs  Article: This piece, written by Geoffrey Hosta, was originally published by the Foundation for Economic Education. When my stepdaughter, Adrienne, was in first grade, her teacher pressured me to put her on stimulants. She explained that Adrienne daydreamed; she also became hyper when she learned something new. Inattention and hyperactivity are classic symptoms of ADHD. They can be treated with Adderall or Ritalin, her teacher explained. But I knew this was absurd. Adrienne did not have ADHD. That just sounds like any bright kid, I responded. If shes ahead of her classmates, shell be bored sometimes. Smart Kids Are More Likely to Be Misdiagnosed  I was on to something. Some scientists believe that kids with IQs in the top 5 to 10 percent of the population are especially at risk for ADHD misdiagnosis. Although there are no hard numbers, experts estimate that somewhere between one-third and one-half of intelligent kids diagnosed with ADHD are misdiagnosed. Even the manual used to diagnose ADHD warns doctors against confusing intelligence with ADHD. Why is misdiagnosing ADHD in intelligent children more likely? As I suspected, smart kids such as Adrienne engage in the same behaviors as children with ADHD. For example, both bright kids and those with ADHD are over-excitable and inattentive. Both question authority. Even so, her teachers suggestion merited further consideration. After all, intelligent children such as Adrienne can still have ADHD. And unaddressed ADHD could make my stepdaughter more likely to abuse substances, suffer joblessness, and falter in school. Consequently, I was not going to ignore Adriennes problem. But I am also a doctor.",0
"Title: Were From the International Community and Were Here to Help  Article: Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. I've always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the Government, and I'm here to help, Ronald Reagan famously said. But the most terrifying words in every other language are, Were from the international community and were here to help. In Haitian Creole that would be, ""Nou soti nan kominote entnasyonal la e nou isit la pou ede."" When an earthquake hit Haiti in 10, everyone who was anyone in the international community quickly showed up. Bill Clinton had been appointed as the UN Special Envoy for Haiti a year earlier where he had touted the unique opportunities for public and private investment in Haiti. The earthquake opened up those opportunities to Clinton Foundation donors. A year later, Bill Clinton was touting a $45 million new hotel owned by an Irish cell phone tycoon who was a close pal as the only thing a country with a million homeless needed. A CNN puff piece claimed that the hotel would house aid workers, potential investors and other visitors. Like Anderson Cooper, who needs someplace to take a hot shower after standing waist deep in water for 5 minutes on camera. Haiti was a gold mine for the Clintons. Literally. Hillarys brother was added to the board of a small company that got a gold mining permit at half the standard rates with a 25 year renewal option. Tony, Hillarys brother, is a college dropout who had worked as a repo man and a prison guard. The Clintons not only turned a disaster into a slush fund, but even got Hillarys idiot brother a gig.",0
"Title: Trump wants a meaner, tougher War on Drugs  Article: President Donald Trump declared this week that he wants law enforcement throughout the nation to get really, really tough, really mean with the drug pushers and drug dealers as his administration makes moves to intensify the nations failed War on Drugs. People form blue ribbon committees, they do everything they can. And, frankly, I have a different take on it. My take is, you have to get really, really tough  really mean  with the drug pushers and the drug dealers, Trump said at a recent event in Ohio. We can do all the blue ribbon committees we want. We have to get a lot tougher than we are. And we have to stop drugs from pouring across our border. Last year, Trump formed the Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis headed by Chris Christie. He also put in a call to Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte around the same time, congratulating the leader for a bloody crackdown on drug pushers in that country. I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem, Trump said at the time. Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that. Reasons Ronald Bailey noted why thats a little disturbing for civil libertarians here in the U.S.:  Duterte is indeed doing an unbelievable job, according to Human Rights Watch. The group estimates that that Dutertes drug war has killed more than 12,000 drug suspects so far. As big a blustering blowhard as our president is, I trust that he is not actually contemplating Duterte-style extrajudicial killings when he says we have to get a lot tougher than we are.",0
"Title: USA: Confederate Army General Revealed to Be a Woman  Article: Austin | George Edward Pickett, a Confederate Army General who played a major role in the last days of the Battle of Gettysburg, was in fact a woman. Newly disclosed information found in the last will of George Picketts father, Colonel Robert Pickett, proves without a doubt the confederate war general was a woman. The discovery was made at an auction in Austin, Texas, this week as american historian Graham Brown got his hands on the precious document. The will proves without a doubt the famous general who participated in the Battle of Gettysburg was in fact Mary Sue Pickett, his older sister. It also appears clearly evident that George Edward Pickett was never part of any military enterprise, but instead, that his sister was in fact the real man behind the legend. Mary Sue Pickett, who was George Picketts senior by one year, was also known to suffer from a rare genetic disorder known as hypertrichosis, a condition where an excess of androgen creates an hormonal unbalance that results in female beard growth. Official documents of the Pickett family released at the auction included documents confirming the death by tuberculosis of George Pickett at the tender age of 16. The death of the only boy of the family of eight possibly devastated his father, Colonel Robert Pickett, who dreamed of leaving a family military legacy behind him. It was not uncommon at the time to fake documents or steal someones identity.",0
"Title: Frank Talk (Like Trump's) Is A Relief After Years Of ""Stilted Robotic Artificiality"" | Blog Posts  Article: There's an interesting sentence in a fund-raising letter I just received from the Claremont Institute. The Claremont, California-based think tank, which publishes the excellent Claremont Review of Books quarterly, has as their overarching theme ""Recovering the American Idea: The mission of the Claremont Institute is to restore the principles of the American Founding to their rightful, preeminent authority in our national life."" In the letter, institute president Ryan Williams explains, ""Today, the Claremont Institute is focused more than ever on how to think about this critical political moment in our nation's history. And what it means for the future of limited government and American constitutionalism."" All well and goodindeed, I'm a (very modest) donor. More intriguing, though, is a later statement in Williams's letter about how the institute's Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence is weighing in, with amicus briefs, on cases before the U.S. Supreme Court including:  Trump v. Hawaii -- In this case, we are supporting the administration's executive authority for national security executive orders blocking immigration from terrorist-infested countries. Terrorist-infested! How refreshingly appropriate! We can be confident that George Orwell would approve.

"Title: Minnesota Muslim Congressional Candidate Ilhan Omar Swore To Apparent Falsehoods In Court, While Divorcing Her Brother  Article: Despite this compelling evidence of dishonesty, Ilhan Omar will almost certainly be elected to Congress: voting against her would be Islamophobic. State Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) Swore to Apparent Falsehoods in Court  While Divorcing Her Alleged Brother, by David Steinberg, PJ Media, August 8, 2018:  Minnesota state Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-60B) is the presumed frontrunner for the MN-5 House seat being vacated by Rep. Keith Ellison (D). The seat is safely Democratic; Hollywood progressives, local party officials, and Minnesota media have all but scheduled the August 14 primary as her coronation. Their enthusiasm is rooted in Omars identity: she is a photogenic, hijab-wearing Muslim who entered the United States as a Somali child refugee. Likely because of this, however, Omars media and party supporters have been aggressively uninterested in a disturbing allegation about Omar with legal ramifications: that in 2009, she seems to have married her brother. That allegation has been public for nearly two years without Omar addressing its specific foundations. Newly uncovered evidence  exclusively published below  adds another allegation: Ilhan Omar has since signed off on apparent falsehoods, under penalty of perjury, during her 2017 divorce from the man in question: Ahmed Nur Said Elmi. take our poll - story continues below  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

"Title: Navajo Nation sues U.S. government for $160 million over toxic waste damage to their community  Article: (Natural News) The Navajo Nation recently filed suit against the United States government  to the tune of nearly $160 million  for damages and ongoing injuries resulting from a mine spill and the toxic waste that was released into the environment near the tribes territory. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken responsibility for the devastating spill, and the agency is also the lawsuits primary target. The lawsuit is seeking a cool $159 million in damages, as well as an additional $3.2 million to cover expenses that have already been submitted to the EPA but have not yet been reimbursed. The catastrophic spill took place in August 2015. An EPA clean-up crew was tasked with pumping out and decontaminating sludge from the mine, but things took a turn for the worse when the team destabilized a dam of loose rocks. Consequently, this led to 3 million gallons of mine waste water and tailings  containing heavy metals like cadmium and lead, and other toxic elements like arsenic and beryllium  into Cement Creek, a tributary of the Animas River. Naturally, the EPA has maintained that this incident was just an accident. However, some have proposed that this was no accident. It was predicted that perhaps the agency would intentionally sabotage the mine as a means to secure Superfund money. And sure enough, just over a year after the accident, the Gold King Mine was declared a Superfund site. On September 7, 2016, the EPA declared that the area would be on its list of contaminated areas due for federally funded clean-up. Why werent they more careful the first time around? Who knows.",0
"Title: Palin for Queen  Article: Palin just finished with the debate tonight, and let me just say, Im a convert, she really sold me tonight. I think shes ready to be queen. And queens dont need no stinkin debate rules. You want to ask her this, shell answer with that  what America really needs to know  about her, about McCain, and about the Republican commitment to families all across this great land, and we just need to reform the economy and get it back on track, and shell do that, because she reformed Alaska, and Alaska has lots of resources there, you know, and it supplies energy for America, and its close to Russia, so she knows about foreign policy there too. Shes a mavericks maverick, and when shes queen, she wont be just part of the executive, because theres flexibility there, and her administration would work with Congress and shell make the most of that flexibility, you know, that was written in the constitution there. And gosh darn it, like the current maverick vice-president Cheney, she would be part of the legislative branch as well, and being the ever-confident reformer, she would likely find a way to be part of the judicial branch too, because America needs that kind of leadership. Heck, maybe she could sit in on the Supreme Court on important issues like abortion and freedom of the press, and what goes into our libraries. The far left says she didnt even pay attention to the questions. But Palin didnt need to  she answers to America. Because thats what the Straight Talk Express is all about.

"Title: Where have all the men gone?  Article: OpinionFaith September 16, 2016 (BreakPoint) -- Are we in the midst of a masculinity crisis? Two Christian writers offered very different answers to this question in recent articles. David French at National Review laments a new statistic that shows todays young men are, physically, the weakest generation in recorded history. If youre the average Millennial male, he writes, your dad is stronger than you are. In fact, you may not be stronger than the average Millennial femaleThe very idea of manual labor is alien to you, and even if you were asked to help, say, build a back porch, the task would exhaust you to the point of uselessness. Welcome to the new, post-masculine reality. Chandler Epp replied to French in a guest column at Religion News Service, arguing that the idea of masculinity being equivalent to physical strength is misguided. Popular Christian notions of manhood, he writes, shame, repel, and ruin too many young boys and men who fail to meet those standards and who dont gravitate toward typical masculine behaviors. He concludes, We must recover the idea that the marker of a true man is his moral strength, not his muscular fitness. Now I know personally both Chandler and French, and I have a lot of respect for them both. In fact, they both demonstrate that sort of moral strength Chandler talks about in his piece. Chandler is right that when most folks ask, Where are all the men? what they mean is something like, where are all the lumberjacks?",0
"Title: Collectivism & Social Engineering Going On Right Under Our Noses  Article: A friend asked me recently if I found any similarities between the collectivist Home Owners Association (HOA) in the U.S. and living in communist Romania in cinder block apartments the size of the average hotel room. We did have a different HOA in these reinforced concrete high rises, the Residents Association (Asociatia Locatarilor). Its governing board was chosen from the least outspoken residents who sometimes doubled as informers to the Security Police, reporting on the comings and goings of the residents and on their political statements made accidentally in ordinary conversations with neighbors. The Residents Association decided when the water heaters were to be serviced, what kind of cold and hot water schedule we were going to follow, how much heat we received from the government mothership, how much any repairs would cost, and how the due bills were to be divided evenly between all families, if the association would pay the electric bill for some widow who was behind on her dues, which mechanic they were going to hire to fix whatever was broken in the apartment complex. In the egalitarian utopia, the total bill was to be split equally between all families, regardless of how many people lived in one apartment. Some had children, some lived alone and the consumption was vastly different but the contribution share had to be equal. It was similar at work; no matter how little effort a person put in, they were paid the same. The incentive died quickly when people realized effort and extra work did not count. But everyone expected that 13th salary at the end of the year  a bonus that few people deserved.",0
"Title: American Citizen Found Guilty Of Helping Al-Qaida Launch Suicide Attack Against US Base  Article: American citizen Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh was found guilty Friday of helping al-Qaida plan a car attack on a U.S. military base in Afghanistan. Jurors found Farekh guilty of supporting a foreign terrorist organization, conspiring to murder Americans and using a weapon of mass destruction, Reuters reports. Today, an American al-Qaeda member was brought to justice in a U.S. courtroom, said Bridget Rohde, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Two vehicles full of bombs hit Forward Operating Base Chapman in Afghanistan Jan. 19, 2009, and the ensuing explosion killed one Afghan and injured several others. But the larger bombs failed to detonate because the second car crashed as a result of the explosion from the first car, leaving Americans totally unscathed. Farekhs fingerprints were found on the bomb that never exploded. Prosecutors stated that Farekh began watching al-Qaida propaganda videos and was partly radicalized by sermons from Anwar al-Awlaki, who the CIA killed in 2011. As such, he plotted with two other students at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, to join the terrorist organization and flew to Pakistan in 2007, serving in al-Qaidas external operations unit until 2014. All of these charges together mean that Farekh, who is originally from Houston, is staring down life in prison when it comes time for his sentencing Jan. 11. Interestingly, Farekh almost didnt have the opportunity to face the possibility of life in prison, as U.S. officials, specifically officials in the CIA, were pushing to authorize a drone strike against him, but ultimately the Obama administration decided against the plan in favor of capture.",1
"Title: Republicans Express Shock That Obama is Acting Like He Won an Election %%  Article: We can all agree that President Obama is a ditherin fool, who should be more like the Great One, George W.

Instead, Hopey charged forward within 72 hours with a response. Cmon, Obama. The people have come to expect a certain somethin from their leaders and that aint it. Obama should have been on vacation in Camp David and THEN gone to his ranch before answering questions, because thats what patriots do.

Geeze, President Obama  whatre you trying to do here? Obama is politicizing terrorism by actually addressing it, which he must know makes the Us Republicans look bad.

Blockchain Stocks Are Next! (ABC) Brides-to-be looking to shed that final 10, 15 or 20 pounds in order to fit into their dream wedding gown have taken a controversial approach to crash dieting that involves inserting a feeding tube into their noses for up to 10 days for a quick fix to rapid weight loss. The K-E diet, which boasts promises of shedding 20 pounds in 10 days, is an increasingly popular alternative to ordinary calorie-counting programs. The program has dieters inserting a feeding tube into their nose that runs to the stomach. Theyre fed a constant slow drip of protein and fat, mixed with water, which contains zero carbohydrates and totals 800 calories a day. Body fat is burned off through a process called ketosis, which leaves muscle intact, Dr. Oliver Di Pietro of Bay Harbor Islands, Fla., said. video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player It is a hunger-free, effective way of dieting, Di Pietro said. Within a few hours and your hunger and appetite go away completely, so patients are actually not hungry at all for the whole 10 days. Thats what is so amazing about this diet. Di Pietro says patients are under a doctors supervision, although theyre not hospitalized during the dieting process. Instead, they carry the food solution with them, in a bag, like a purse, keeping the tube in their nose for 10 days straight.",0
"Title: CNNs Chris Cillizza, Along With Peers In The Mainstream Media, Are Rapidly Losing Their Credibility  Article: CNNs Chris Cillizza, along with most of his peers in the mainstream media, are rapidly losing their credibility. They are ignoring the real story at their peril. CNNs Chris Cillizza is absolutely outraged that President Trump would not allow himself to fall into Adam Schiffs obvious trap. The rebuttal memo, intentionally filled with highly sensitive, classified material, was written to provide Adam Schiff with a new opportunity to attack Trump. Schiff and his fellow Democrats were well aware that the rebuttal memo would not be able to be declassified without major redactions to protect sensitive information. He knew that Trump would have to either heavily redact the memo, or not release it. Either scenario would provide Schiff with ammunition. Instead of his administration making the redactions and igniting a political firestorm, Trump chose a third option, the least bad option. He essentially told Schiff to make the necessary changes himself, remove the sources and methods that Schiff railed about prior to the release of the Nunes (which the Nunes memo did not contain, and yes, Schiff had read the document and was very well aware of this fact) and then we can release it. The White House included a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray that says they have identified portions of the Democratic memo that would raise national security or law enforcement concerns if released publicly.",1

"Title: 9/11: Never Forget Project  Article: The 17th anniversary of September 11, 2001 is upon us and the Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) at Ripon College had been planning a 9/11 project. Evidently, the schools Bias Protocol Board is not too enthused over it. YAFs 9/11: Never Forget Project, which began 15 years ago, consists of 2,977 flags representing each life that was extinguished on that day of infamy, as well as a poster featuring multiple images and photographs of the Islamic terrorists who murdered them. According to YAF, its members were informed that the project, particularly the poster, is objectionable because it relentlessly targets one religious organization, one religious group, one religious identity [.] As such, it gives rise to an environment within which students from a Muslim background would feel singled out and/or harassed. A spokesperson from Ripon said that school officials merely offered student representatives of YAF suggestions as to how to have a discussion about 9/11 this year with our entire campus and community (emphasis mine). Presumably, YAFs project as such is insufficiently inclusive. Of course, the idea that there is something Islamophobic about remembering 9/11, or about doing so with explicit reference to the Islamic terrorists who were responsible for it, has been circulating for quite some time. Three years ago, for example, The Daily Beasthardly a conservative or right-wing publicationconfirmed that students at the University of Minnesota killed a proposed moment of silence for 9/11 victims due to concernsthat Muslim students would be offended. To its credit, the author of the Beast essay recognizes these concerns as insulting and childish.",1
"Title: Australian Pro-Life Groups Say New PM a Pro-Abort, Feminist Radical  Article: News By Hilary White CANBERRA, August 10, 2010 (LifeSiteNews.com)  Pro-family campaigners have warned that Julia Gillard, elected in June as Australias new Prime Minister, is a radical feminist whose unqualified support for abortion and the homosexualist agenda is reflected in the constitution of Australias Emilys List, a group that gives financial support to far left, feminist, pro-abortion and homosexualist candidates. Gillard recently said in an interview posted to the website of Emilys List that she was asked to be a founder of the group by Victoria state Premier Joan Kirner, and to use my legal skills to write its constitution. In the interview, Gillard praised the group for placing a number of other pro-abortion feminists into significant roles in government, including the cabinet. Among others, she named Jennifer Macklin, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and Nicola Roxon, the Minister for Health and Ageing. Gillard, a self-described atheist and the first female Prime Minister of Australia, is the head of the Australian Labour party and cohabits with her hairdresser boyfriend, Tim Mathieson. At university, Gillard was a student activist, supporting a broad range of left-wing causes. She rose to be head of the radical Australian Union of Students and acted as a senior official in the Socialist Forum. John Ballantyne, writing in the Weekly News independent magazine, said that Gillard is not the mainstream, centrist leader that the media want us to think she is.",1
"Title: New research suggests fracking is probably poisoning the air  Article: Trees may be brown because of the seasons, not the air quality Trees may be brown because of the seasons, not the air quality The researchers found that hydraulic fracturing -- a technique for releasing natural gas from below-ground rock formations -- emits pollutants known as PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), including some that are linked with increased risk of cancer and respiratory ailments. ""Air pollution from fracking operations may pose an under-recognized health hazard to people living near them,"" said the study's coauthor Kim Anderson, an environmental chemist with OSU's College of Agricultural Sciences. Haynes got in touch with Anderson and Kincl, and together they designed the study to include citizen participation. They placed air samplers on the properties of 23 volunteers living or working at sites ranging from right next to a gas well to a little more than three miles away. The samplers picked up high levels of PAHs across the study area. Levels were highest closest to the wells and decreased by about 30 percent with distance. Even the lowest levels -- detected on sites more than a mile away from a well -- were higher than previous researchers had found in downtown Chicago and near a Belgian oil refinery. They were about 10 times higher than in a rural Michigan area with no natural gas wells. The team also accounted for the influences of wood smoke and vehicle exhaust, common sources of airborne pyrogenic PAHs. Wood smoke was consistent across the sampling area, supporting the conclusion that the gas wells were contributing to the higher PAH levels.",0
"Title: Trumps first-year approval rating mirrors Obamas  Article: Despite mounds of negative publicity and outright fake news about him, his policies and first-year accomplishments, President Donald Trump is ending his first year in office with an approval rating that mirrors and in some ways exceeds his predecessors. According to data from Rasmussen, which tracked approval ratings for Barack Obama and Trump, Trump ends the year at 46 percent approval and 53 percent disapproval  the exact spread Obama ended his first year with. Recall that Obama received fawning, slobbering media coverage for everything he did and said. MSNBCs Chris Matthews actually said on air that hearing Obama speak causes him to feel this thrill going up my leg. I dont have that too often. Matthews all but teared up on air in a segment of Morning Joe, and also called Obamas election New Testament stuff. And he was far from alone in his bootlicking. Coverage of Obama was so over-the-top in Obamas candidacy that Time magazines Mark Halperin warned his Obama-toady media colleagues about their pro-Obama bias. That type of coverage continued throughout Obamas first year. Conversely, Trumps dealt with the ongoing fake Russia collusion scandal, along with dishonest fact-twisting and omission of truths done deliberately in order to cast him in a negative light. According to Pew Research Center, early coverage of Trump has been three times more negative than it was for Obama (62 percent negative for Trump versus 20 percent negative for Obama) in their first years. This was a continuation of the coverage Trump got during the run-up to the election.",0
"Title: A Reader Writes On The Merciless Indian Savages Of The Founding Era And An American Woman Who Fought Back | Letters  Article: Re: James Fulfords post Facebook, REASON Magazine, Thomas Jefferson, And The Merciless Indian Savages  From: A German-American Reader [Email him]  With regards to the latest hysterical banning by Facebook of the passage from the Declaration of Independence citing merciless Indian Savages brings up some interesting points. The first is that due to the revisionist history currently in vogue in the United States the only part of the Declaration now remembered is the flowery language in the Preamble stating all men are created equal that specifically, and only refers to the perceived unequal relationship between the British colonists and the Cr own. It was never intended to be a universalism, later used as a justification for a plethora of equal outcome-based laws and social justice programs that bedevil the nation. The Preamble should be interpreted in the context of the entire document, and in the case of the Declaration it was a list of strident grievances (e.g. directed Indian attacks) and demands by the rough and tumble British colonists justifying the colonies breakaway from Great Britain. I am sure the Facebook censorship staff have never read the entire Declaration of Independence before this incident, hence their shock. The second point is that depending on the tribe and circumstances the American Indians could be a nasty lot as was well known at the time being before the era of todays politically correct censorship (e.g. Facebook). And the colonists who did fight back were not hauled off into court for denying the Indians their civil rights.",1
"Title: Saudi man loses right to drive after undergoing sex change surgery  Article: A religious court in Saudi Arabia has decided this morning to invalidate the drivers license of a man because he underwent an operation to become a woman. 34-year old Abulrahiim al-Qahtani, now known as Salsabyl al-Qahtani, underwent a sex change operation in Germany in November 2015 and lived there for over two years. She decided to return to Saudi Arabia in December, and her parents left a car for her at the airport so she could drive by herself to their residence. Unfortunately for her, she was arrested by members of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPV), the Saudi religious police. Even if she still had a valid Saudi drivers license, she was immediately arrested by the religious police and her vehicle was seized. She spent 17 days in prison before her familys lawyers and foreign non-governmental organizations were able to obtain her liberation. Her drivers license was still revoked, however, and her case was transferred to the Islamic tribunal. This morning, after less than two hours of deliberation, she was declared mentally unfit to drive a vehicle by an Islamic court, in Jeddah. The three judges declared that Ms. al-Qahtanis desire to become a woman, by itself, proves that she has mental problems. Allah created man in his own image.",0
"Title: National Data | Why Immigrants In Los Angeles (AND THEIR U.S.-BORN CHILDREN) Can`t Read | Articles  Article: If you were told that more than half of the adult inhabitants of the 17th largest economy in the world couldn't read, you would probably think it was a less developed country like Pakistan or Nigeria. Well, think again. The place is in the good old US of A.: Los Angeles. A new study by the United Way of Los Angeles finds that 53 percent of the city's adult population3.8 million peopleare functionally illiterate. [United Way, Literacy@Work: The L.A. Workforce Literacy Project, September 2004.] The percentage soars to 84 percent in heavily Hispanic south L.A., dropping to 44 percent in the greater San Fernando Valley. [Table 1.] When we last checked, only 41 percent of Los Angeles' population was foreign-born. (See U.S. Census Bureau, The Foreign Born Population: 2000, December 2003). Thus the illiteracy problem in that city is not limited to immigrants. Many of their U.S.-born children must also be functionally illiterate. But the ultimate cause of LA illiteracy is mass immigration. Directly, it constantly resupplies the illiterate pool. Indirectly, it overwhelms the assimilative mechanism. The quality of English instruction for native non-Hispanic Angelenos must also suffer when resources are diverted to classes full of immigrants (Not that anyone seems to care). Here are figures for 2000:  Limited English Fluency: L.A. County: 31 percent; U.S.: 8 percent  Adults w/o HS diploma: L.A. County 30 percent; U.S.: 20 percent  High School Dropout Rate: L.A.

But does practicing deprivation really work? Whether it be from drinking or judging, the more we tell ourselves no, the more we want it. And setting up your new year coming from a place of fear and negativity is no way to live. So how do we change our attitudes? First off, we must change how we view the New Year. When you are reflecting on how you would like to approach the end of the year, try viewing it as an opportunity to release the year and embrace the new one ahead. Next, try incorporating meaningful rituals to help you let go of 2015, regardless of what happened. Its time to make room for what lies ahead. 1.",0
