"Title: Yellowstone Volcano latest: Big One fears as 153 EARTHQUAKES strike Yellowstone in July  Article: The University of Utah Seismograph Station, which is responsible for the operation and analysis of the Yellowstone Seismic Network, revealed 153 earthquakes hit the Yellowstone National Park region in July. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the largest quake had a magnitude of 2.5 and was part of a small sequence of 12 earthquakes. A larger sequence of 77 earthquakes occurred 14 miles south-southwest of Mammoth in Wyoming during the time period between July 16 and 27. Yellowstone is the site of the largest and most diverse collection of natural thermal features  The largest earthquake was a micro earthquake of magnitude 2.3 which struck on July 24 at 8:40pm. Larger earth sequences like these are fairly common and they account for roughly half of the total seismic activity in the Yellowstone National Park. The USGS also revealed that steamboat geysers remained active in July, with eruptions on July 6 and 20.

"Title: Obamas Thug-In-Chief John Brennan blames Trump and Netanyahu for Palestinian deaths in Gaza  Article: Here is clear evidence of John Brennan siding with the jihad force. This is typical of the leftists who filled the Obama administration. Much as Hitler knew he could count on Der Strmer, genocidal, Jew-hating Muslims can always count on the enemedia and leftist government officials such as Brennan to spin, scrub and market Islamic Jew-hatred. Tens of thousands of Jew-hating Muslims storm Israels border chanting Khaybar, Khaybar, the genocidal chant of Jew-hating Muslims evoking Muhammads extermination of an entire tribe of Jews, are further proof that the Muslim war on the Jews is a religious war, not a geographical one. Imagine thousands of genocidal America-haters, armed with bombs and meat cleavers, storming our borders chanting warnings of another 9/11. take our poll - story continues below  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

"Title: $4 Million In Gold Bars Stolen In 11th Largest Heist In History  Infinite Unknown  Article: $4 Million In Gold Bars Stolen In 11th Largest Heist In History (ZeroHedge, March 2, 2015): Long-time Zero Hedge readers may remember the rather surreal moment towards the beginning of the long-running German tungsten/gold repatriation saga, when Bundesbank Executive Board member Andreas Dombret assured the NY Fed that Germany wasnt afraid of Simon Gruber (or Goldfinger for that matter) masterminding gold heists in U.S. vaults. Well, since it now appears Germany is all set to ramp up its repatriation efforts (see the NY Feds November monthly outflow numbers), Buba may want to reconsider its stance on the threat posed by ambitious bandits, as less than 24 hours ago, an estimated 4 million in gold bars were commandeered (on the side of I-95 no less), by gun wielding desperados. From CBS: North Carolina authorities and the FBI are investigating the theft of an estimated $4 million worth of gold allegedly stolen during an armed robbery along Interstate 95 on Sunday evening, CBS affiliate WRAL reports. After mechanical problems with their truck, two armed guards who were traveling from Miami to Massachusetts with a shipment of silver and gold pulled over at mile marker 114 on the Interstate. According to the station, the sheriffs office says the guards reported that three armed men in a white van approached them, ordered them to the ground, tied their hands behind their backs and forced them to walk into some nearby woods.",0
"Title: Clinton Ally: No One Cares if the DNC Rigged Primaries  Article: This is the kind of contempt for democracy and the rule of law that we need more of. Here's Terry McAuliffe, the close Clinton ally who once headed the DNC, explaining that absolutely no one cares if the DNC rigged the primaries. KATY TUR, MSNBC: I want to ask you about Donna Brazile and the allegations that are coming out in her new book. There's a lot of people on both sides of the issue here saying that the DNC is completely rigged. There are other saying it's not rigged at all, this is completely just the way politics works and people are making too a big deal over it. The fact of the matter is it's in the news, it's casting a negative spotlight on the Democratic party. I mean, you have to have some concern about how that's going to play out in Virginia. Correct? GOV. TERRY McAULIFFE (D-VA), FORMER DNC CHAIRMAN: Nobody cares. TUR: Nobody cares? Let's listen to Donna Brazile. One more time on This Week. McAULIFFE: Nobody cares what's Donna Brazile has said in a book. Nobody. TUR: Governor, one second. Let's listen to Donna Brazile. DONNA BRAZILE: For those who are telling me to shut up, they told Hillary that a couple months ago, you know what I tell them? Go to hell. I'm going to tell my story. TUR: You don't think anybody cares about her story? McAULIFFE: Nobody cares. You know what they care about? They care about beating Donald Trump tomorrow, they care about beating Ed Gillespie. Not one person in Virginia who is looking for a job, wants to get healthcare, making sure their kids get a quality education. I mean I know everybody in Washington in the little bubble loves to talk about this stuff. I did not get asked.",1
"Title: Sweden's Election: ""The Conflict Is Between Those Who Want To Destroy Our Country And Those Who Are Trying To Save It."" Mid-Term Slogan For Trump? | Articles  Article: See earlier (2010! ): The Sweden DemocratsAlone Against Establishment Extremists  Not so long ago, the word Sweden brought to mind Pippi Longstocking-style rural idylls, ABBA, and the unashamed attitude to nudity satirised in a 2003 Simpsons episode in which traffic in Stockholm is directed by a naked policewoman. But if you go to Stockholm these days, youll be confronted with a train station that resembles downtown Baghdad, the widespread groping of females who arent in Islamic dress, and police officers absent from Islamic no go zones. The sky-high levels of trust and cooperativeness that gave us the gleaming Ikea-stereotype have resulted in an unarmed invasion and a collective death wish. Women darent walk the streets; and if they report getting raped by a refugee then theyre racist and somehow to blame. But a growing minority of Swedes seem to have had enough. Theyre increasingly realising that their Sweden can and will be completely lost. And it seems they intend to make their feelings heard load and clear in the Swedish parliamentary elections to be held September 9. If the polls are correct, then the Sweden Democratsled by 38 year-old former web-designer Jimmie kessonmay get as much as 20% of the vote, in a country whose electoral system is pretty close to pure Proportional Representation; the country being divided into a number of large multi-member regions [Swedens far-right poised for record election gains, AFP, The Local, August 26, 2018]. Considering the consensual nature of Swedish politics, the rise of the Sweden Democrats has been astounding.",1
"Title: Defiant Libya  Article: Qaddafi pulls the knife from his back and stabs back. US has been strafing civilians from air for 10 years. This DHS drone, like the ones in Afghanistan, will start with reconnaissance. Tony Cartalucci, Contributing Writer Activist Post There really is no way to strafe your enemies from the air without killing innocent people and incurring considerable collateral damage, ask any Iraqi Afghan , or Pakistani who suffers such attacks by the United States on a nearly daily basis. And while the United States and NATO have justified for decades now these grievous tactics, they are suddenly quite sensitive regarding their use in opposition to their hoped toppling of Libyas Qaddafi. Deciphering the events on the ground in Libya is admittedly difficult. But we can be sure of one thing, the globalists want Qaddafi out and his defiance has conjured an almost tangible, rabid fit from the global-corporate elite whose future plans hinge on the domino effect they most assuredly started in Tunisia and Egypt with US-funded CANVAS, International Crisis Group ElBaradei, and the US-trained, funded, and directed April 6 Movement in Egypt. US has been strafing civilians from air for 10 years. This DHS drone, like the ones in Afghanistan, will start with reconnaissance. The International Crisis Group, of which Egypts protest leader Mohamed ElBaradei sits as a trustee beside Zbigniew Brzezinski, George Soros (the Funding Father of Egypts new constitution), notorious neo-con Richard Armitage, and NATOs Wesley Clarke, has made a statement calling on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to implement a no-fly zone over Libyan airspace.",1
"Title: Those who think Canadas Defense Minister will resign are living in the past  Article: Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE If those who are demanding Sajjans resignation think he will resign because it is the honourable thing to do, they are sadly living in the past. Its all about power, not honour Those who think Canadas Defense Minister will resign are living in the past In the past few days there have been calls for Harjit Sajjan to resign his cabinet post as the Minister of Defense. While it is certainly possible he might resign if he personally cannot take the heat, or if Justin Trudeau believes it is politically expedient to get rid of him, there is no way he will ever resign as a matter of honour. Sajjan, a former Vancouver police officer, was also in the Canadian reserves and did tours of duty in Bosnia and Afghanistan. His first tour of duty in Afghanistan was in 2006; Sajjan arrived there shortly before Operation Medusa commenced. Operation Medusa was the biggest Canada-involved combat operation since the Korean War. Although there is no official count, it is estimated 1,500 members of the Taliban were killed during the operation. Some Canadians also lost their lives. The former cop served as an intelligence officer during his tours of duty in Afghanistan. On April 18, Sajjan was in New Delhi where he was speaking to a group of security experts. The Defense Minister described himself as being the architect of Operation Medusa. It was a blatant lie and not the first time he told it. He said the same thing back in 2015 and said the fact he was the architect of the operation came from Gen. Jonathan Vance, who currently holds the position of chief of defense staff.",0
"Title: Court orders Sherri Shepherd to pay child support for surrogate son she abandoned  Article: NewsBioethics November 27, 2015 (LifeSiteNews) -- Sherri Shepherd, a Hollywood celebrity who co-hosted the popular talk show The View for seven years, has lost a maternity suit launched by her ex-husband Lamar Sally, forcing her to pay him alimony and child support for their one-year surrogate son LJ. The decision follows an unseemly fight which pro-life blogger Cassy Fiano says has exposed how surrogacy results in commodifying the unborn. Shepherd, a co-host of the View from 2007 to 2014, met Sally, a screenwriter, in 2010 and they married a year later. Because her eggs were not viable, they arranged a surrogate mother in Pennsylvania to bear them a baby conceived in vitro using Sallys sperm and a donated egg. But the marriage soured in mid-term about the time Shepherd lost her job with The View. According to one tabloid explanation, she was worried he would contribute little to parenting responsibilities. Sally filed for separation in 2014, Shepherd filed for divorce a few days, then Sally sued for sole custody, then alimony and child support. Earlier this year she told PEOPLE she had gone along with the surrogacy to prevent the breakup of the marriage and had not really wanted the child. Shepherd, an avowed Christian who once denied evolution on The View and a successful comic actor on Broadway, TV, and in film since the mid-90s, didnt want anything to do with LJ, as Lamar named the boy, who after all carried none of her genes.",0
"Title: Psychologist Claims Racism Accusers Are Pedophiles Seeking To Hide Their Own Sickness  Article: By Ivan Fernando A prominent white supremacist psychologist, Prof. Philippe Lynn, of Rhodesia University in Zimbabwe, has written a paper claiming that anyone who identifies another person as a racist, is a pedophile. He goes on to say that the one making the claim is trying to somehow distract others from his or her own criminal sexual proclivities. Prof. Lynns disgusting and deeply offensive paper has been e-mailed to university professors around the world, and is making the rounds at Americas colleges, which have always been hot-beds of radical right-wing extremist and xenophobic thought. Just 53 years ago, some US colleges remained segregated by race! Only yesterday, just 151 years ago, white Americans in the south still owned black slaves and daily tortured them for their own sadistic pleasure! Here are some extracts from this deeply offensive so-called psychological report: The racism sniffers find racism everywhere. Even where it obviously does not exist. It is reminiscent of the Salem witch trials that the Puritans held. In fact, in at least 99% of cases I have personally examined, the person being accused of racism is not only not a racist at all, but an avowed anti-racist. Given this fact, we must assume that the person making the accusation knows perfectly well that the accused is not racist at all. The accuser is making the accusation in bad faith, in order to hide a profound and disturbing secret. The accuser is a pedophile who wants to hurt innocent children! This connection is undeniable. Correction, only pedophiles deny this connection! This line of reasoning makes absolutely no sense at all.",1
"Title: Flynns Case Proves Its Time to Fire Mueller  Article: Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. Petraeus, Obamas CIA Director, lied to FBI agents about passing classified materials to his mistress. Despite being caught in the lie on a recording, he was never charged for it, as Flynn was. Instead he only pleaded guilty to mishandling classified information and received a slap on the wrist. While Justice Department personnel had wanted to hold Petraeus accountable, the final decision was made by Attorney General Holder and FBI Director Comey. Lawyers for Petraeus insisted that he couldnt be charged with lying to the FBI because DOJ guidelines recommend not charging in situations in which a suspect, during an investigation, merely denies guilt in response to questioning by the government. Petraeus admitted making false statements, but was never charged over them. Thats what makes Flynns case so striking. General Petraeus lied about committing a crime. His mishandling of classified information was a serious issue. And yet he was never charged for it. General Flynn lied about something that was not a crime. His conversations were authorized by officials in the incoming Trump administration. And even by the outgoing Obama administration. A week before Trumps inauguration, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said that there was nothing necessarily inappropriate about contact between members of the incoming administration and foreign officials because Flynn was part of the transition team. The question had been about Flynns contacts with the Russian ambassador.",1
"Title: 57-year old virgin sues his former school for teaching him abstinence  Article: HUNTSVILLE, Alabama | A man has filed a $450,000 civil lawsuit against his former high school for inappropriately promoting abstinence as part of the sexual education program, saying these teachings had ruined his life. 57-year James Holmes says the sexual education he received at the Jemison High School was traumatizing and has caused him some severe psychological problems. In an interview with ABC, he described the content of the sexual education classes which he says caused his psychological trauma. They taught us that God would smite us if we masturbated and that we would burn in Hell for eternity if we had sex before marriage. They showed us pictures of genitals infected with STDs and told us it was what God did to adulterers. These classes had such an impact on Mr. Holmes that whenever he thinks about sex, even today, he suffers from a severe panic attack. Im 47-year old and Im still a virgin.",0
"Title: Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch Plus A Whole Lot More!  Article: Inspector General Michael Horowitz report on the FBIs handling of the Clinton email investigation has finally been released to the public and while it does indeed lambaste former FBI Director James Comey for his terrible judgment and handling of the Clinton investigation, it stops short of blaming it all on politics.

"Title: Author of controversial gold standard study on gay parenting being investigated by university  Article: NewsHomosexuality July 16, 2012 (LifeSiteNews.com) - The University of Texas has launched a scientific misconduct investigation of UT sociologist Mark Regnerus, after he was accused by homosexual activists of scientific misconduct in his recent study. Regnerus study, published in the July issue of Social Science Research, found that children of homosexual parents have significantly more social and mental-health problems than children of heterosexual parents. The study has been described as a gold standard study, because of its use of a large, random sample, with responses coming from the children of opposite sex and same-sex parents. Previous studies on the subject of homosexual parenting have typically used small convenience samples, and have often relied on the responses of the parents, rather than the children. The study raised a tremendous outcry from gay rights activists, including from Scott Rosensweig, or Scott Rose, a writer on LGBTQ issues for The New Civil Rights Movement blog. The University of Texas began the investigation shortly after Rosensweig wrote an open letter to William Powers, the president of UT, claiming that Regnerus was guilty of scientific misconduct because the study was designed so as to be guaranteed to make gay people look bad, through means plainly fraudulent and defamatory. Rosensweig also accused Regnerus of being politically biased, because he received funding from institutions, such as the Witherspoon Institute and The Bradley Foundation, that are said to support traditional marriage.",0
"Title: Do It For Denmark Ad Encourages Immoral White Reproduction Instead of Immigration  Article: By Ray Charlston A shockingly offensive video ad is circulating the internet. The ad entitled Do it for Denmark encourages Danish couples to go on a vacation getaway. Demographic data is misleadingly skewed to suggest that there are not enough young Danes to support the aging population of the country. The ad encourages reproduction! Couples who can prove a conception occurred during the getaway will be eligible to win three years worth of free baby supplies! Readers may view the video below. Do so at your own risk however, it is very offensive and blatantly racist and homophobic! Denmark does not need reproduction, what it really needs is immigration, especially from the third world to solve its demographic crisis! Reproducing more Danes does nothing to enrich Danish culture and society. It is also shockingly immoral given the mass starvation, poverty, illiteracy, disease and oppression which those in the third world suffer entirely because of white racism and white privilege. Since homosexuals cannot reproduce through sexual intercourse with persons of the same gender, the entire campaign is blatantly homophobic! Unfortunately, some Danish fear-mongers still ignorantly claim that immigrants are a burden on the economy and that they commit more crime than the native born. It is understandable that in a racist white society, many immigrants would require economic aid in order to survive.",1
"Title: Suicide Note Seen in Vegas Shooters Hotel Room  Article: A mysterious piece of paper discovered last week, when photos from the Las Vegas gunmans hotel room were leaked to the media, is now back in the news cycle. The pictures were published by numerous news outlets and shared by millions of people on social media. At the time the photos were published by the Daily Mail, police had not mentioned if Paddock left behind a note in his hotel room. Nevada Sheriff Joe Lombardo said police were investigating who leaked the crime scene photos. In one photo in particular, a white piece of paper or notepad on a side table next to a chair is visible, which caused some to speculate that it may have been a suicide note. Soon after the photos were leaked, Twitter was abuzz with chatter referencing the paper, with people spreading cover-up conspiracies and rumors that it was a suicide note.

"Title: Lie detection equates to who barks or yells the loudest  Article: Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE A heavy price will be paid in allowing emotion to guide our choices in a presidential campaign that far overshadows initial anger and frustration at overreaching government Lie detection equates to who barks or yells the loudest Projection is what psychologists attach to individuals who project their own behavior onto others, and, in this presidential race, the practice has run rampant. There are two candidates in particular who so believe that they deserve the presidency that they will stoop to new depths to attain their objective. It is fascinating to see poll leaders in both parties act so similarly on stage when either referring to opponents not present or blaring directly at a fellow candidate occupying the same dais. As much as people like to root for their champion, in polite society (which is less and less evident during speeches) opponents recognize others right to opine and explain their position. Monday, February 15, Hillary Clinton somehow believed that barking like a dog trained to spot lying was a favorable image for her campaign. Granted, she was attempting to tag republicans as lying rather than attacking her democrat colleague, but how constructive was the tactic? Did it really promote her as a truth-detector, or did it open the door for some other unflattering comparison? The major point is that Clinton has been caught lying about everything from criminally mishandling classified information to ignoring repeated calls for assistance from one of her charges, an ambassador under death threat in Benghazi.

"Title: Aborting Humanae Vitae: How Can the Church Deal with the Bergoglian Quantum Leap?  Article: The conventional wisdom is that  this disastrous papacy  lies on a continuum of post-Vatican II ecclesial decline on which Francis represents but the lowest point yet reached. This is true, but only superficially. If we look more deeply into the phenomenon that Antonio Socci has dubbed Bergoglianism, we see an actual break with the continuum, a quantum leap into the chaotic realm of the mind of one badly formed Jesuit, fascinated by his own disordered thinking. An analogy to atomic physics struck me as helpful in assessing the effects of the Bergoglian quantum leap. When an electron orbiting a nucleus makes a quantum leap (a transition to a higher definite energy level) its distance from the nucleus increases, the attraction of the nucleus weakens, and the atom becomes less stable, meaning more likely to combine with surrounding atoms by way of ionization. When ionization occurs, a new stable electron configuration is reached. By analogy, the Bergoglian quantum leap is inducing the human element of the Church to reach a different energy level with respect to the nucleus of Tradition, moving even further away from the nucleus than it was at the previous energy level, thereby reaching a new level of instability and thus even greater susceptibility to being combined with worldly thinking in a more stable absorption into the world.",0

"Title: Trump Humiliates Himself By Claiming That There Is No Drought In California %%  Article: Donald Trump humiliated himself by claiming that the California drought doesnt exist and that he will solve the states problems by turning the water back on. Video: Trump said: Were going to solve your water problem. You have a water problem that is so insane. It is so ridiculous where theyre taking the water and shoving it out to seaThey dont understand  nobody understands it. There is no drought. .. I have received many many environmental rewards.

According to Trump, the drought is a conspiracy from environmentalists that he will solve simply by turning the water back on to the farms. Unless Donald Trump has a secret weather machine, the only thing that can solve Californias water issues is more rain. Donald Trump like the rest of the members of his party is trying to pass off denial as a public policy. Pretending that the drought doesnt exist is not a solution.

"Title: Boeing Must Produce Iran Air Contract to Terror Victims  Article: The Trump administration pointedly put national security over trade when it told an Illinois District Court judge it does not take a position on whether the Court should shield aerospace giant Boeing Corp from a lawsuit filed by victims of Iranian state terrorism. The family of Shlomo Leibovitch is seeking to collect on a $67 million judgment against Iran for a 2003 terror attack that killed their seven-year old daughter, and sued Boeing to gain access to what it believed were Iranian assets in Boeings possession. Boeing signed a $16 billion deal in 2016 to sell civilian airliners to the state-owned Iran Air, a defendant in numerous lawsuits by victims of Iranian state-sponsored terrorism. In any airplane deal of that size, the purchaser will make advance payments while the aircraft are being produced. It was those payments the Leibovitch family was seeking to attach and that Boeing was seeking to conceal. Chief Judge Ruben Castillo ruled on Tuesday that Boeing must produce the contractual documents to the terror victims, to include financial documents relating to advance payments as well as Boeings communications with the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control, which licensed the sale during the final weeks of the Obama administration. Boeing had argued to keep all details of its commercial and financial dealings with the Iranian regime secret, on the grounds that disclosing them would cause significant harm to the goals of the United States and its European allies.",1

"Title: Progressives Threaten Peaceful Violence In The Wake of Rising Microaggressions  Article: by Dr. Trifecta Tyrone Washington II, D.D., Ph.D, Distinguished Civil Rights Leader Progressives are rightly outraged at the recent spate of white-male terrorist incidents across the US. Whites are attacking innocent people of color, women, sexual minorities, and the trans community. We will no longer stand by and allow this to continue. We can, and we must, stand together now in moral outrage! More and more progressives are talking about peaceful violence. Peaceful violence may sound like a contradiction to some, however, it makes sense when you examine it closely. According to one member of Masked Red Anarchists Destroying Hate, Ill call him Michael: Racism is violence. A racist thought is a violent one. Racists must be met not with ideas or arguments, but only with insults, fists and weapons. That is the language that they understand. The so-called violence we carry out is peaceful. Why? Because its directed against those whose ideas head toward violence. It isnt violence when your victim is a racist non-person. These are Nazis! According to the imminent social scientist and writer, Dr. Norman Frederickson: We must understand that a racist isnt a human being. A racist is a monster! A racist doesnt have any friends, family, or pets. Racists are people who live on pure hatred. They are incapable of love, or compassion. Is their blood red too, like ours? We dont know! The Fascist police protect them, and we cant tell. A more spiritual person might say that racists do not have souls. A privileged white person cannot possibly understand the struggles that people of color face daily in racist, islamophobic, and heterosexist America! People of color have had enough.",1
"Title: Moloch Loses a Round: Iowa Governor Signs Historic Anti-Abortion Law  Article: The Internet is exploding with coverage of Iowa governor's historic signature. Today, while protesters outside chanted ""My body, My Choice"", Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law the strictest abortion regulation in the US:  From the Chicago Tribune: Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds on Friday signed a law banning most abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected, or at around six weeks of pregnancy, marking the strictest abortion regulation in the nation  but setting the state up for a lengthy court fight....The ban, set to take effect on July 1, has propelled Iowa to the front of a push among conservative statehouses jockeying to enact restrictive regulations on the medical procedure. Mississippi passed a law earlier this year banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, but it's on hold after a court challenge. ...Backers of the so-called heartbeat bill  which didn't get a single Democratic vote in the Legislature during final passage  expressed hope it could challenge Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that established women have a right to terminate pregnancies until a fetus is viable. Conservatives say an influx of right-leaning judicial appointments under President Donald Trump could make it a possibility. From the Associated Press: Iowa Gov.",1
"Title: Doctor delivers patients baby, and then gives birth hours later  Article: NewsCulture of Life, Family FRANKFORT, Kentucky, August 1, 2017 (LifeSiteNews)  An obstetrician in Kentucky was waiting to give birth to her own baby when she came to the aid of another woman in the ward. Dr. Amanda Hess, 38, had checked into the Frankfort Regional Medical Center to give birth to her second child through induced labor when she heard a woman crying in pain. Hess discovered that both the expectant mother and her unborn baby were in distress and that the on-call obstetrician had left the hospital on break before they arrived. Undressed and in an open-backed hospital gown, Hess tied on another gown to cover up [her] backside and came to the rescue. Hess recognized the patient, Leah Halliday-Johnston, as she had performed her last prenatal examination earlier that week. The unborn babys heartbeat was dangerously low and her umbilical cord was loosely tied around her neck, so there was no time to wait for the on-call doctor, still 10 minutes away. Hess stayed to deliver the baby. The on-call doctor arrived shortly afterward and took it from there. You know I love doing what I do, Hess told Kentuckys WKYT news. I love taking care of mothers and babies and ... really a lot of doctors are always thinking of their patients even when they're a patient themselves. "" [Hess] was definitely in doctor mode, Halliday-Johnson, also 38, later told NBC. My husband noticed something was going on because she had on a hospital gown, but I didnt notice that because I was on the delivery table. I was in my own world there. Halliday-Johnston gave birth to a baby girl, her fourth child.",0
"Title: Progressives Condemn Racist and Islamophobic European Advocates For Women  Article: By Werombi Towradji A new organization that claims to advocate on behalf of women has come under fire, with allegations that, despite appearances to the contrary, it actually seeks to stealthily spread racial hatred and Islamophobic bigotry. Despite all their rhetoric about rape, the so-called European Advocates For Women is a group of racist nationalists who oppose immigrants because of the color of their skin and their religious beliefs  nothing more. This terrorist group is asking women who are being attacked to violently repel their innocent immigrant attackers with tasers and pepper spray  all under the guise of protecting themselves from alleged rapists! As many respected academics have shown, we know that rape is about power only, and since White males are the ones with power, only White males can rape. So obviously, Muslims cannot be rapists. Attacking and otherizing Muslims as rapists, is not acceptable, and progressives must speak out against it. Let me be clear, the real rape epidemic is driven by White males. Muslims are not raping White women, period! They are, however, tragically being scapegoated by racists. This demonization has many parallels to the demonization that Jews underwent before World War II by Nazi Germany! So I thought, what better way to make these connections than to interview a well-known Jewish ethnic activist, Barbara Specter. Werombi Towradji: Thank you Barbara for sitting down with me for this interview. I am a great admirer of your work in promoting non-White immigration and multi-culturalism in Europe.",0
"Title: Dean Baker: 'Welcome to the Second Great Depression'  Article: The piece speaks for itself, and in the clear layperson-friendly language that characterizes Baker's work. He points out that the reason the economic downturn in the thirties became what we now call is the Great Depression, was mass unemployment; to be more precise, it was the political failure to respond to mass unemployment due to a dangerous and misplaced concern about budget deficits - sound familiar? Unfortunately, the country seems destined to follow the same course in the current slump as it did in the 30s. The May jobs report should have provided the sort of stiff kick that is needed to revive discussion of additional stimulus. Instead, it seems to have barely shaken Washingtons ongoing obsession with deficits. He points out that a poor labor market amounts to not only fewer jobs but also less income because workers don't have the bargaining power to demand better wages. The horrid labor market, plus the $7 trillion (and ongoing) deflation of the housing bubble, is limiting consumption, which accounts for 70 percent of demand in the economy. In theory, he says, relief could come in the form of trade generated by massive increase in demand from trading partners, but they're also suffering economically. That leaves government. With these other sectors accounted for, this leaves the government as the only remaining candidate for boosting the economy. But additional stimulus is not even on the agenda in Washington. Instead, we are seeing cutbacks at all levels of government. These cutbacks led to a loss of 29,000 jobs in May.",1
"Title: Fox News Labels Shakira A Liar on AZ Immigration Law %%  Article: Fox News went on the attack today against Colombian pop singer Shakira, because she was in Arizona yesterday speaking out against that states immigration law. This morning on Fox and Friends Brian Kilmeade said, We know her hips dont lie, but we arent so sure about her lips. Because the singer dared to criticize a Fox News supported policy, she now joins LL Cool J on their enemies list. Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters: Fox and Friends mockingly introduced video of Shakira in Phoenix yesterday stating her opposition to the law. She said, Im in opposition to this law because it is a violation of human and civil rights. It goes all human dignity, against the principles of most Americans that I knowI dont want to this law tarnish what this country stands for. We can not let fear and injustice take over. Steve Doocy of Fox News framed Shakira as from Columbia and hating the idea of the law. Of course, this is Fox News, so that wasnt enough. Brian Kilmeade also called her a liar. He said, We know her hips dont lie, but we arent so sure about her lips. According to Fox as any opposition to the Arizona law based on civil rights is a lie, and Shakira is a liar for stating her belief that this law is a violation of American principles. Shakira is not your usual self absorbed pop star. She is a UNICEF global ambassador. She has been honored by Oxford for her work on the issues of children and education, and she has been honored by the United Nations for her work on behalf of children, education, and social justice, but yet gets labeled a liar for stating an opinion that Fox News disagrees with.",1

The $outhern Poverty Law Center, which had a spy in the audience, posed an amazingly quick summary (they have more money than we do). Now a kind reader has provided a complete transcript. I was introduced by an old friend of VDARE.COM, Professor Paul Gottfried. Thank you, Paul [Gottfried]. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

"Title: 2009 Keeper of the Flame Award: Dick Cheney  Article: On October 21st in Washington, the Center for Security Policy hosted its annual Keeper of the Flame Award dinner. This years honoree was former Vice President Richard Cheney who used it as a platform for a major policy address  one that provided but the latest validation of the appropriateness of this recognition. Mr. Cheneys extraordinary public service was celebrated by nearly 400 Members of Congress, past and present members of the armed forces, business leaders, journalists and other security policy practitioners at the elegant gala held at Washingtons venerable Union Station. The Vice Presidents remarks constituted an authoritative and forceful critique of the conduct of national defense and foreign affairs under the Obama administration. They received world-wide attention thanks to the coverage given it by ABC News, C-SPAN, the Associated Press, Fox News and the Washington Post. Particular note was made of Mr. Cheneys warning that the White House appeared to be dithering over the strategy for the war in Afghanistan and his call upon President Barack Obama to do what it takes to win.

"Title: If Dems Really Wanted to Ban Guns, They Would Stop Trying  Article: Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. When President Trump won, it was good news for the stock market and for many industries. But firearms manufacturers werent one of them. Gun sales had hit astronomical numbers under a hostile administration. Threats of confiscations and restrictions were one ingredient in the sales boom. But firearms ownership was also a cultural statement of opposition to the new leftist ruling class. Firearms manufacturers had been expecting a Hillary victory and a post-election burst of buying. Instead the Trump Slump arrived. It hit manufacturers, gun store owners, lobbies and activists. Anecdotally, I heard from activist groups how challenging getting people involved had suddenly become. The NRA shifted to an ad campaign that seemed more about cultural warfare than fighting gun control legislation. But the slump only lasted until a new gun control push rolled in. Since February 2018, every month this year has seen the number of background checks (a statistic used to partially track firearms sales) exceed the same number in 2017. The Parkland shootings happened in February. The gun control exploitation and legislative surge that followed boosted March checks to 2.7 million. That number is so huge that it seems to have no precedent in the database. If Michael Bloomberg were truly brilliant, he would have secretly invested in firearms manufacturers before beginning his latest campaign. Flagging firearms stocks have been recovering and rising.",1
"Title: America's Immigration Voice.  Article: Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III has threatened Sanctuary Cities with lawsuits over their failure to follow federal law over communications to the Federal government concerning aliens held by those cities' law enforcement officials. The ultimate result will be loss to the cities of certain law enforcement grants. This is small potatoes compared to the criminal activity by those sanctuary cities which take numerous actions to protect illegal aliens from discovery and arrest, as well as giving said aliens benefits to remain in the United States. Also apparently not on Attorney General Sessions to-do list is a lawsuit against California's Sanctuary State law that prohibits business owners and law enforcement from cooperating with immigration law enforcement. The Justice Department is threatening 23 so-called sanctuary cities, including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, with subpoenas if they fail to provide documents to show whether local law enforcement officers are sharing information with federal immigration authorities. The demand, outlined Wednesday by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, represents a new escalation by the Trump administration to punish local jurisdictions that do not fully comply with federal immigration enforcement efforts, including by sharing the immigration status of local prisoners. The subpoena threat comes as Congress prepares to restart talks on revamping the immigration system, days after lawmakers' failure to reach an agreement on the politically-charged issue led to a three-day government shutdown.",1
"Title: Documentary shows beauty in the struggle against same-sex attraction  Article: OpinionFaith, Homosexuality Theres a saying about changing the world by telling a good story. When first clicking on the link to watch the newly-released Desire of the Everlasting Hills, you might be suspecting some syrupy presentation on preserving the environment, or perhaps a knockoff of Heaven is for Real. But a few minutes into the film you immediately become drawn into the lives of three individuals  Paul, Dan, and Rilene  who candidly lay bare their souls as they describe their journey through life with same-sex attraction. A little more than halfway through the 60-minute film, youll very likely find yourself crying as they share their testimony to Gods grace breaking through and changing their lives. By the end, youll probably be thanking God that you were able to witness the power of His transforming love in the lives of these people who courageously and humbly tell their stories. How does Desire succeed in telling a good story on such a sensitive and often explosive topic? For one thing, it completely bypasses the characteristic polarization on the homosexuality issue  namely, if you dont support and even advocate for acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle then you must hate and loathe people with same-sex attraction  by simply letting the individuals tell their story. The filmmakers do not ask leading questions, postulate their own theories, or refer to public opinion polls. They simply offer raw storytelling by real individuals who have experienced something life-changing and wish to share it with others. Its real people telling real stories that leave far behind the politically correct narratives.",1
"Title: Gay Groups Target DOMA with New Lawsuits  Article: News By Peter J. Smith NEW YORK, November 10, 2010 (LifeSiteNews.com)  Two more lawsuits have been launched against the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), bringing even more legal pressure to bear on the beleaguered marriage law. The Gay & Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Hartford, Connecticut on behalf of three homosexual couples and one widower who were denied federal spousal benefits. DOMA must fall, said Mary L. Bonauto, GLADs Civil Rights Project Director. Bonauto contended that the intent of passing DOMA in 1996 was to harm gay people and same-sex families with this law, and sadly, it has succeeded. Married gay and lesbian couples fall through the federal safety nets that exist for other married people, she said. The case is Pedersen et al. v. Office of Personnel Management, and is the second front GLAD has opened up against DOMA. Earlier this summer a U.S. District Judge in Massachusetts ruled unconstitutional Section 3 of DOMA, which defines marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of a man and a woman.",0
"Title: Chernobyl AIDS  Infinite Unknown  Article: For your information. PDF: Geomagnetic Storms, EMP and Nuclear Armageddon (Nexus Magazine Article)  Geomagnetic Storms, EMP and Nuclear Armageddon (Nexus Magazine Article) (When Technology Fails): There are nearly 450 nuclear reactors in the world, with hundreds more either under construction or in the planning stages. There are 104 of these reactors in the USA and 195 in Europe. Imagine what havoc it would wreak on our civilization and the planets ecosystems if we were to suddenly witness not just one or two nuclear melt-downs but 400 or more! How likely is it that our world might experience an event that could ultimately cause hundreds of reactors to fail and melt down at approximately the same time? I venture to say that, unless we take significant protective measures, this apocalyptic scenario is not only possible but probable. Consider the ongoing problems caused by three reactor core meltdowns, explosions, and breached containment vessels at Japans Fukushima Daiichi facility, and the subsequent health and environmental issues. Consider the millions of innocent victims that have already died or continue to suffer from horrific radiation-related health problems (Chernobyl AIDS, epidemic cancers, chronic fatigue, etc) resulting from the Chernobyl reactor explosions, fires, and fallout. If just two serious nuclear disasters, spaced 25 years apart, could cause such horrendous environmental catastrophes, it is hard to imagine how we could ever hope to recover from hundreds of similar nuclear incidents occurring simultaneously across the planet.",0
"Title: Democrats Distance Themselves From Hillary: ""New"" DNC Denies Knowledge Of Trump Dossier Funding  Article: Following the shocking (to some) revelations from WaPo with regard Hillary Clinton and the 'old' Democratic National Committee's financing of the infamous ""Trump Dossier,"" the 'new' DNC has rushed out a press release denying any involvement as Democrats begin rapidly distancing themselves from this un-fake news. In a brief statement from DNC Comms Director Xochitl Hinojosa, ""Tom Perez and the new leadership of the DNC were not involved in any decision-making regarding Fusion-GPS, nor were they aware that Perkins Coie was working with the organization. "" Of course, the DNC then added - for good measure... ""But let's be clear, there is a serious federal investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, and the American public deserves to know what happened. "" All of which is quite ironic following Perez' comments during the week: We have the most dangerous president in American history and one of the most reactionary Congresses in American history, Democratic Chairman Tom Perez said during his speech. Perez also labeled Trump an existential threat with no apparent worry that his words could be taken, along with those by Waters and other liberals in the media, as ammunition for a crazy leftist to once again attack Congress or even the White House. And even more ironic in light of the increasing evidence and investigation surrounding Hillary Clinton's dealing with the Russians over Uranium One.

"Title: How to Identify Someone With High-Functioning Depression  Article: Most of us share the same mental image of someone living with depression. This person struggles to get out of bed and face the day, often calling in sick to work or canceling plans with their friends. They cant stop crying, unable to control or manage their emotions. Isolating themselves from friends and family, they stay hidden in their home, often sleeping much of the day away. Identified as the leading cause of disability among Americans aged 15 to 45, the Anxiety and Depression Association of America estimates that over 16 million adults in the United States are currently battling major depressive disorder. The problem is that the above stigma alienates a significant size portion of the population that suffers from depression each and every day, those that are able to continue on with their life as if they are okay, while still experiencing the devastating and challenging effects of depression internally. This is known as high-functioning depression. Carol Landau, a clinical professor of psychiatry and human behavior and medicine at Brown University, has dedicated a significant portion of her career to better understanding this form of depression, and how it differs from our previous understanding of this illness. Landau discusses this common mindset, stating: Were still striving to be caregivers, and part of that is not admitting we need help. But its a huge problem.

"Title: Polands president backs strengthening abortion law for the sake of the country  Article: NewsAbortion WARSAW, Poland, January 30, 2017 (LifeSiteNews)  Polands leader wants to see the countrys abortion law changed. President Andrzej Duda spoke on issues ranging from abortion to Donald Trump to homosexual marriage during a 40-minute interview last week with the conservative private station TV Republika. Asked if it is possible politically to better protect the unborn, Duda recalled social upheaval after two opposing abortion drafts failed in the Parliament last year. One would have completely banned abortions and the other would have introduced abortion on demand (up to 12 weeks). Even though the pro-life bill fared better in Parliament, it was ultimately rejected amid pro-abortion Black Protests and procedural irregularities. Both proposals were ""citizens bills. According to Polish law, a group of citizens can propose a bill to the Parliament after collecting at least 100,000 signatures of support within three months. Because both drafts came from a grassroots movement, as opposed to politicians, Duda said, ""they should be treated seriously and the same way, regardless of the content. The president acknowledged that he supports the protection of life not only for religious reasons but also for the sake of the country. In other words, Poland, like most European countries, needs to raise its birth rate. Duda emphasized, however, his own pro-life credentials.

"Title: Falling from the 1% to the bottom of the 99%  Article: I graduated in 2003 with my Bachelor's degree in music education. I was much more fortunate than most - I graduated college with essentially zero debt - but the coming years would prove to me that the choice I had made to pursue my dream would cost me any security that I might have otherwise had. And so, the little actual debt that I did have sat at the edge of my vision, like a dark, angry cloud on the horizon - and it would only get worse. I took my teacher's certification tests and earned a certification, and went hunting for a job. To a point, I got lucky - I found a gig teaching at a small Catholic high school in 2003. My pay as a full-time high school teacher: $23,300 (gross). The school had little going for it in terms of its musical endeavors; enrollment had dwindled sharply since the 80s across the board, and the school had figured out that adding sport after sport brought more donations to the school. A school of over 500 students in the early 80s had dwindled to just barely above 200 by the time I made it there, and the band program, which had at one time been a point of pride for the school, had fallen by the wayside and become an object of derision and scorn from both the students and some of the teachers. I had just seven people in my band. My goal was to turn it around as best I could and try to make the kids who were involved in it be proud to be a part of it. I was largely successful in my first year. I formed a pep band for the home football games, which provided a spark of life that had otherwise been unheard of at the ballgames.

"Title: George Soros: The Man Behind The Mayhem  Article: This man has been pushing to break borders among other things. However, he seems oblivious to the obvious push-back he is receiving. George Soros is mayhem itself. He is constantly contradicting himself. For instance, by pushing for broken borders and increased immigration he is undermining his desire to create a unified Europe. He acknowledges that there is an immigration crisis going on in Europe and then also states that the EU is a cherished project. Why is he pushing immigration to the Eus point of breaking? Soros placed a bet about who was going to win the United States Presidential election and lost. This loss cost him one billion dollars. Soros is obviously concerned at this point because of Hillary Clintons rejection. Soros claims that he is now afraid that America will not be able to protect and promote democracy in the rest of the world. His new world order is obviously disordering itself as he believes that Trump is not going to put the US through as many wars and coups as Clinton would have done without necessity.
