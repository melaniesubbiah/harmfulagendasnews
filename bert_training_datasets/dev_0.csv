"Title: Irwin vs. Fletcher on China  Article: (Before It's News) Heres a letter to The Huffington Post: Ian Fletcher writes that What progress against poverty has occurred in the world in recent decades has not been due to free trade, but due to the embrace of mercantilism and industrial policy by some poor nations. According to the World Bank, the entire net global decline in the number of people living in poverty since 1981 has been in mercantilist China, where free trade is spurned (Free Trade Isnt Helping World Poverty, March 19) Overlook the unbelievable claim, allegedly taken from World Bank data (for which Mr. Fletcher offers neither link nor citation), that China alone is responsible for the past 30 years of the globes net decline in number of people living in poverty. Focus instead on Mr. Fletchers assertion that Chinas recent growth is due to that countrys embrace of mercantilism and its spurning of free trade. This assertion is simply wrong. While its true that China  like nearly every other nation on earth  has in place a plethora of growth-inhibiting mercantilist policies, the overwhelming economic story in China over the past 33 years is the liberalization of its markets  a liberalization that includes dramatic reductions in trade barriers. Heres economist Douglas Irwin: In December 1978 China began to end its policy of economic isolation. Under the leadership of Deng Xiaopeng, the government decollectivized agriculture, allowed private entities to trade, and permitted foreign investment. In 1992 the weighted average tariff [in China] on manufactured goods was over 45 percent. Since China joined the WTO in 2001, the countrys average tariff will eventually fall to less than 7 percent.* Mr.",0
"Title: Why Wright Matters: Obamas on a Mission from God  Article: Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! A REPUBLIC, IF YOU CAN KEEP IT. ~BENJAMIN FRANKLIN By Tom Rowan | May 20, 2012 | American Thinker When Elwood retrieved his brother Jake from Joliet prison, the two went on a pilgrimage to their childhood Catholic orphanage. Their pitiful orphanage was under siege from Chicagos infamously oppressive tax regime and was being put out of business. For inspiration, the brothers were directed to a Chicago Baptist church. The church was filled with laughter and love, song and dance, and miraculous divine inspiration that set the Blues Brothers on their own mission with a purpose: keep hope alive for Chicago orphans by paying off the corrupt Chicago regime. The movie rendition of an all-black Baptist church led by the charismatic James Brown preacher, thrilling his flock with high-spirited love and devotion, is what gave The Blues Brothers soul. This was what America imagined successful, loving black churches in Chicago looked like. No wonder, then, that Reverend Wrights scream for God to damn America is so jarring even to this day. Reverend Wrights sentiment and his rants do not belong in any American church. Getting people high on hating America and its so-called white oppressors is what carnival barkers like Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson do for a living. Most Americans still find it hard to reconcile the rage and the hate being preached at our presidents old house of worship. Christians get high on love, not hate. Christians are encouraged to be forgiving, not condemning. Christians seek to spread the good news and Christs commandment that [y]ou shall love your neighbor as yourself.",1
"Title: Rasmussen Poll: Trump's Approval Rating Among Black Voters Now 29% vs. 15% One Year Ago  Article: New Rasmussen poll results point to an increase in President Trump's approval among black voters to 29% from 15% one year ago. And it would not take a huge shift in black voter sentiment to sway an election. If the results of this poll, a near doubling of support in one year, are genuine and sustainable, Democrats have reason to worry. Although this news may sound surprising, there are valid reasons for blacks to gravitate toward Trump. Democratic candidates generally take black support for granted, but Trump has actually made an effort to reach out to the black community. #ICYMI: From yesterday: Todays @realDonaldTrump approval ratings among black voters: 29% take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

"Title: America's Egalitarian TemptationStalinism's Unquiet Ghost | Articles  Article: Peter Brimelow writes: On November 21, 2008, I spoke in Baltimore at the inaugural meeting of the H.L. Mencken Club, part of the fascinating reformulation now proceeding on the Right in the wake of the collapse of the established conservative movement. The $outhern Poverty Law Center, which had a spy in the audience, posed an amazingly quick summary (they have more money than we do). Now a kind reader has provided a complete transcript. I was introduced by an old friend of VDARE.COM, Professor Paul Gottfried. Thank you, Paul [Gottfried]. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I want to thank Bill Regnery and Richard Spencer and all the directors of the H.L. Mencken Club. It's a great honor to be invited to speak at your inaugural meeting here tonight. I know that this organization went through a number of fires to get this conference started. All I can say is it's clearly been purified! There's nobody here for the money! There are no foundation executives or other careerists! We don't have that problem! You are all here out of pure principle. And the fact is that the late, great American Conservative Movement used to be like this. I'm old enough to remember. I emigrated to it in 1970. This is how it used to be. At one point at Forbes, I used to interview every year Milton Friedman, the great free market economist, who was actually also a great man. (Although I realize that he has critics here, Tom! [Piataksee here]) And he once said to me, in the mid-nineties, that it was to his great surprise late in his long lifeand he was 94 when he diedthat he had suddenly started to meet stupid libertariansstupid free market economists.",0
"Title: Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump  Article: Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. WASHINGTON  Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a message for Donald Trump: Youre wrong, Mr. President. Sessions long has been one of Trumps favorite pinatas, often taking the brunt of the presidents public scorn. Trump offered this assessment of his hand-picked attorney general recusing himself from the Justice Departments special counsel probe of Russian election meddling: What kind of man is this? Trump, in an interview that aired Thursday morning, also blasted Sessions because, he said, the former Alabama senator never took control of the Justice Department. About seven hours later, the countrys top law enforcement officer fired back. And, by doing so, took on Trump publicly in a way few Republicans in Washington have during his turbulent 19-month-old presidency. I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the Presidents agenda  one that protects the safety and security and rights of the American people, reduces violent crime, enforces our immigration laws, promotes economic growth, and advances religious liberty, the AG said in a statement. While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations. I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action, Sessions added. However, no nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States.",0
"Title: Republicans Fooled Americans Again To Eliminate Womens Reproductive Rights  Article: Most Americans are familiar with the adage, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. Unfortunately, even though Americans are aware they were fooled in the 2010 midterm elections, particularly American women, they were fooled again and gave Republicans control of Congress. It is the epitome of Einsteins famous quote that insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome. It is also the epitome of stupid and if nothing else, the results of the 2014 midterms revealed that for the most part Americans are inherently stupid people. In the lead up to the 2014 midterms, exactly like the 2010 midterms, Republicans pledged that if they won control of Congress, they would focus on jobs and growing the economy. In fact, the day Mitch McConnell was sworn in as Senate Majority Leader, he had the temerity to say that now Serious adults are in charge here, and we intend to make progress. The House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), openly stated that Were focused on job creation and running a more efficient, effective, accountable government. That stated focus was a lie, but that is what Republicans are known for and yet Americans elected them anyway. Both McCarthy and McConnells assertions sounded precisely like Republicans in 2011 when they took control of the House, and yet the first items on their agenda besides taking steps to slash Social Security, give the Kochs and John Boehner a pipeline gift, were attacks on womens reproductive rights. (Continued Below) Not only are Republicans not adults or focused on job creation or the least bit concerned about running a more efficient government, they are dirty liars.",1
"Title: Dems Go after Gina Haspel with the Torture Smear  Article: Bruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. Gina Haspel, Trumps pick to succeed Mike Pompeo as head of the CIA, is a thirty-year veteran of the agency, one well respected by intelligence professionals from both parties. If confirmed, she will be the first woman to run our most important security agency. But despite this feminist victory, the Dems are likely to muddy the waters at her confirmation hearings by smearing her with allegations she oversaw torture at a black site in Thailand in 2002. Typical of what we can expect is the New York Times editorial titled, Having a Torturer Lead the CIA, even as the charge about the black site was shown to be untrue. Once again, the party bereft of ideas and principle resorts to emotional obfuscation and accusation to advance their ideological prejudices. So, once again, it is necessary to lay out the facts and partisan hypocrisy behind the torture charge that has damaged our ability to gather the intelligence necessary to defend our safety and security. Start with the imprecise or even willfully distorted language that always perfumes unsavory ideologies. In everyday use, torture can mean anything from a visit to the dentist to the sadistic mayhem of brutal regimes like Iran or North Korea. As a result, indiscriminate, lurid connotations and emotions attend the use of a word like torture, which of course is what makes it so useful for partisan smears. Laws, however, have to be more precise.",1
"Title: Erdogan's Threat to Jerusalem  Article: In an unprecedented move, President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday, December 6, 2017, that the U.S. recognizes Jerusalem as Israels official capital. In an almost 20-minute speech, President Trump said, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Trump added, For more than two decades previous presidents have signed a waiver to delay moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, and while previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver, today, I am delivering. Turkeys dictator, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is at it again, threatening Israel with cutting off diplomatic relations should the Trump administration recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital. In a meeting with a parliamentary group of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Erdogan stated that, This (referring to U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital) could go as far as cutting our diplomatic relations with Israel. You cannot take such a step. He furthermore warned the Trump administration that recognizing Jerusalem would be a red line for Muslims. He suggested that Turkey will take measures in the event of a possible U.S. move, including the convening of the 57 nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Istanbul. Erdogans bluster regarding President Trumps announcement on Jerusalem included such a far-fetched statement as, Such a move would not only be a violation of international law, but also a big blow the conscience of humanity.",0
"Title: Millions of America's Gun Nuts Aren't Hiding Their Yearning for Civil War %%  Article: This country is in trouble; not the sequester or the debt ceiling or closing down the country. The Fed and Congress can reverse those issues in a finger snap. Our trouble is coming from the barrel of a gun from rabid paranoids and the people on the take. Include also, terrified legislators staring down that barrel from clever manipulators like Karl Rove, in the employ of filthy rich maggots with no conscience. The farce that is the congressional reaction to the Sandy Hook Bushmaster Childrens Slaughter (BCS) continues unabated. A Senate Judiciary Panel was holding a February 27 hearing on a bill laughingly described as an assault weapons ban (with a mere 2,200 exceptions). Before them was a tearful construction worker Neil Heslin. Hes the father of 1 of the 20 BCS child victims, cherubic, six-year-old Jesse Lewis Heslin. He held up a framed photo portrait of Jesse sitting on his dads lap, the picture the very quintessence of a loving parent-child relationship. Neither the grieving parent or the portrait seemed to emotionally change a single expression or mind of the right-wing gun worshiping members of the panel. Most of whom were wondering which fancy restaurant the gun lobbyists would spring for after the ordeal of hearing yet another sob story was over. Heslin had also appeared as one of numerous invitees to a series of General Assembly Task Force hearings held in several rooms of the Legislative Office Building about five weeks prior to the Senate Judiciary Panel. An estimated 1,500 NRA gun nuts were out in force. Some of them split off into the room where Heslin was testifying.",1
"Title: Defiant Libya  Article: Qaddafi pulls the knife from his back and stabs back. US has been strafing civilians from air for 10 years. This DHS drone, like the ones in Afghanistan, will start with reconnaissance. Tony Cartalucci, Contributing Writer Activist Post There really is no way to strafe your enemies from the air without killing innocent people and incurring considerable collateral damage, ask any Iraqi Afghan , or Pakistani who suffers such attacks by the United States on a nearly daily basis. And while the United States and NATO have justified for decades now these grievous tactics, they are suddenly quite sensitive regarding their use in opposition to their hoped toppling of Libyas Qaddafi. Deciphering the events on the ground in Libya is admittedly difficult. But we can be sure of one thing, the globalists want Qaddafi out and his defiance has conjured an almost tangible, rabid fit from the global-corporate elite whose future plans hinge on the domino effect they most assuredly started in Tunisia and Egypt with US-funded CANVAS, International Crisis Group ElBaradei, and the US-trained, funded, and directed April 6 Movement in Egypt. US has been strafing civilians from air for 10 years. This DHS drone, like the ones in Afghanistan, will start with reconnaissance. The International Crisis Group, of which Egypts protest leader Mohamed ElBaradei sits as a trustee beside Zbigniew Brzezinski, George Soros (the Funding Father of Egypts new constitution), notorious neo-con Richard Armitage, and NATOs Wesley Clarke, has made a statement calling on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to implement a no-fly zone over Libyan airspace.",1
"Title: Take a ride on the crazy train  Article: A state of war exists when there is declared or undeclared military conflict. But this is not the only war. A state of war exists when oppressive authority under color of law and seductive persuasion gradually diminishes our natural rights to life, liberty and property. Today we live in a state of war with the U.S. government. The fact that almost no one is aware is a tribute to the deceptiveness of our political process. Why do most people not feel the oppression of government in spite of so many things that look so obvious to some of us? I can give you one answer and I believe it to be true: The more dependent one is on government authority, the less likely he is to see government and its politicians as an adversary. Another answer is the power that government and its change agents have to manipulate language and stoke class, race and political warfare in order to redirect animus away from government. And if you watch carefully you will see that the government and political class change sides on the issues as they ebb and flow in the national discourse. Thats because the only side the government and political class is on is their own side. And its opposite the peoples side. Nowhere is this more evident than the new debate over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the evil stepchild of the Department of Homeland Security. ICE was formed in 2003 in the aftermath of 9/11 as one of the myriad liberty-stealing laws and government agencies created ostensibly to keep us safe. Keep us safe is one of the many code words politicians and other government men use to oppress us.",1
"Title: Donald Trump Signs Anti-Abortion Executive Order  Article: On Monday President Trump signed three executive orders, one of which has the whole United States angry. Trump first signed an executive order formally ending the United States participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, fulfilling one of his core campaign promises. He also signed one freezing federal hiring, and lastly, an executive action to limit abortion funding overseas. Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy, also known as the global gag rule, which was first put in place by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. The action prohibits giving U.S. funding to international nongovernmental organizations that offer or advise on a wide range of family planning and reproductive health options if they include abortion. Annually, the United States spends about $$600 million on international assistance for family planning and reproductive health programs. The regulation has been something of a political football, instituted by Republican administrations and rescinded by Democratic ones since 1984. Most recently, President Barack Obama ended the ban in 2009. Trump signed it one day after the Jan. 22 anniversary of the Supreme Courts 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion in the United States, the date which is traditionally when presidents take action on the policy. The policy also prohibits taxpayer funding for groups that lobby to legalize abortion or promote it as a family planning method. This policy forbids foreign nongovernmental organizations that receive federal funding from performing or promoting abortion services through their work in other countries.",0
"Title: American Border Patrol Feature  Article: Newsweek -- November 25, 2017 CAN THIS LATINO LAWMAKER HELP STOP TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE? Antonio Villaraigosa has a shot at becoming California's first Latino governor since 1875. But he doesn't want to hear that. I'm an American, not only a Latino, Villaraigosa said in a recent interview with Newsweek. I love this country. With the election still a year away, Villaraigosa, who appeared on the cover of Newsweek after becoming Los Angeles' first Latino mayor in 2005, already faces a long road to Sacramento. His chief opponent, former mayor of San Francisco and current Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, a so-called golden boy of California politics, is out-polling and out-fundraising him. ....Last month, his campaign released a 12-minute video created by Mark Putnam, the director behind one of Barack Obama's famous 30-minute campaign video during the 2008 presidential election. In the video, Villaraigosa celebrates his working-class and Latino background while blasting the Trump administration's onslaught of anti-immigration policies. Glenn Spencer -- December 23, 2017 Can President Trump Save California? Antonio Villaraigosa stands a good chance of being elected governor of California.

"Title: Woman drugged her ex-boyfriend and tattooed her face all over him  Article: Cincinnati, OH | An Ohio man that was being stalked for months by his ex-girlfriend claims she drugged him and tattooed him while he was unconscious. Andrew Whitmore, 44, woke up in incredible pain and soaked in blood in his exs apartment and realized only moments later what had really happened. He had been drugged and his ex-girlfriend had tattooed her face all over his chest, arms, legs, back, posterior and even on his genitals. She even tattooed her face on my dick, he told reporters in shock. I cant even go pee without seeing her face on my dick and balls, he said in disbelief. She kept screaming, no one will ever want to sleep with you again. You are mine, mine!!! he recalls. Dropped charges Weirdly enough, Whitmore did not file any complaint against his ex-girlfriend who reportedly tattooed her face on his body 77 times, and the couple has even started dating again. Overall, I kind of felt guilty over the whole deal. Im the one who cheated on her like forty times and got her hooked on crystal meth and crack cocaine. And now that Im tattooed with her face all over my body, ass cheeks and genitals, seriously, would anybody else want to hook up with me? he said jokingly. I mean, at the end, a vagina is a vagina, and women are basically all crazy, so why not stick around with her? he said with humor. What worse thing could happen?",0
"Title: #MeToo: Female Sexual Assault Accuser Settles With Her Own Accuser Following Allegations of Sexual Assault  Article: OK, I know, settling with someone doesn't necessarily imply that the person is guilty. Sometimes it is simply to get it out of the media's sights, especially when you are in the spotlight. However, I find it ironic that Italian actress and #MeToo champion Asia Argento, who was one of the first to come forward and accuser movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, has now settled a sexual assault allegation brought against her for $380,000. The New York Times reports:  But in the months that followed her revelations about Mr. Weinstein last October, Ms. Argento quietly arranged to pay $380,000 to her own accuser: Jimmy Bennett, a young actor and rock musician who said she had sexually assaulted him in a California hotel room years earlier, when he was only two months past his 17th birthday. She was 37. The age of consent in California is 18. That claim and the subsequent arrangement for payments are laid out in documents between lawyers for Ms. Argento and Mr. Bennett, a former child actor who once played her son in a movie. The documents, which were sent to The New York Times through encrypted email by an unidentified party, include a selfie dated May 9, 2013, of the two lying in bed. As part of the agreement, Mr. Bennett, who is now 22, gave the photograph and its copyright to Ms. Argento, now 42. Three people familiar with the case said the documents were authentic. The Times has tried repeatedly since Thursday to get a response to the matter from Ms. Argento and her representatives. She did not reply to messages left on her phone, sent by email and sent to two of her agents, who agreed to forward it to her.",1
"Title: Boeing Must Produce Iran Air Contract to Terror Victims  Article: The Trump administration pointedly put national security over trade when it told an Illinois District Court judge it does not take a position on whether the Court should shield aerospace giant Boeing Corp from a lawsuit filed by victims of Iranian state terrorism. The family of Shlomo Leibovitch is seeking to collect on a $67 million judgment against Iran for a 2003 terror attack that killed their seven-year old daughter, and sued Boeing to gain access to what it believed were Iranian assets in Boeings possession. Boeing signed a $16 billion deal in 2016 to sell civilian airliners to the state-owned Iran Air, a defendant in numerous lawsuits by victims of Iranian state-sponsored terrorism. In any airplane deal of that size, the purchaser will make advance payments while the aircraft are being produced. It was those payments the Leibovitch family was seeking to attach and that Boeing was seeking to conceal. Chief Judge Ruben Castillo ruled on Tuesday that Boeing must produce the contractual documents to the terror victims, to include financial documents relating to advance payments as well as Boeings communications with the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control, which licensed the sale during the final weeks of the Obama administration. Boeing had argued to keep all details of its commercial and financial dealings with the Iranian regime secret, on the grounds that disclosing them would cause significant harm to the goals of the United States and its European allies.",1
"Title: Senator Flake's Sad, Pathetic and Ignorant Speech  Article: Senator Flake, a politician who works hard at pretending to believe something, gave a speech attacking the President of the United States for criticizing the media. This Doonesbury character come to life 'courageously' delivered a speech defending major media conglomerates and their right to override elections. Because he loves freedom and truth. The speech perfectly captured Flake's insipid cluelessness. It reads like it was written by a college sophomore who is very passionate about ideas, but doesn't actually understand them. Take his opening. ""Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident ..."" So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America."" It's an applause line, but no one's applauding except the leftist media that hates the founders and Jefferson. It's also a line that could have only been produced by googling, ""founders"" and ""truth"". Jefferson wasn't writing about truth, as Flake invokes it, but about the principles on which this nation is based. And he's saying that being self-evident, they don't require further philosophical proofs. It has nothing to do with ""shared facts between the governed and the government."" That's a creepy prog idea with a whiff of 1984.",1
"Title: After Being Kicked Off Show, Trump Supporting Pastor Tells Joy Reid To Move To Haiti %%  Article: Shortly after MSNBCs Joy Reid laid an epic smackdown on Trump supporting pastor Mark Burns and eventually kicked him off the show, Burns fled to the safety of his Twitter page to attack the cable news host. In the video, the pastor told Reid that she should move to Haiti since shes more concerned about Haitian immigrants than black Americans here in poverty. The full video: #AMJoy should moved to #Haiti since she cares more for Haitians than Black Americans here in Poverty https://t.co/xtcBTqyKI5  Pastor Mark Burns (@pastormarkburns) January 13, 2018 A portion of Burnss post-interview comments: Just wanted to say to Joy, who I consider a friend, shes always been very kind and I think fair to me, but I think obviously in the interview you just saw, if you watched Joy Reid, that she should just move to Haiti since shes more concerned about Haitian immigrants than black Americans here in poverty, in America. IF youre so concerned about the Haitians then you should move to Haiti and donate your checks to those families who are in need in Haiti. The offensive attack on Reid by Burns comes after Reid called him out for using religion to defend both Trumps racist shithole comment and his policy position that the United States should send Haitians back to their country. If the country is so broken, then how can you as a man of God justify sending people back to that country? Reid asked during the interview. Burns didnt have an adequate response and the interview unraveled from there, with the MSNBC host eventually ending the interview by telling the pastor, Youre wasting my time.",0
"Title: Get Ready To Pack Your Bags  Article: Things are about to heat up in the EU. Italys ministers threaten the EU/EMU with mass deportations. Italys new leaders tell 500,000 immigrants: Pack Your Bags. The right-wing Lega party, which formed a coalition government with Five-Star Movement (M5S) last week, is the driving force behind anti-immigration rhetoric and it is looking to fulfil a pledge to deport as many as 500,000 illegal migrants. Lega leader Matteo Salvini  who is now Italys deputy prime minister and interior minister  reiterated the governments aim to deport illegal migrants on a visit to Sicily last weekend. On Saturday, speaking at a rally in northern Italy, Salvini had told illegal migrants get ready to pack your bags. On Sunday, Salvini said the only way to avoid more deaths was to stop people getting on boats in the first place. He caused a diplomatic row by accusing Tunisia of sending convicts over to Italy in migrant boats. Michael Flynn, executive director of the GDP, told CNBC that the Italian governments proposals to deport around 500,000 people were ridiculous, costly and impracticable. Amazon.com Gift Card i...

"Title: Rubio Sacrificed His Campaign to Save America  Article: Marco Rubios campaign ended yesterday. He wont acknowledge it and neither will his hardcore supporters for some days, but he is done. It was one thing when he was running more or less even with Cruz across the South, like he did on Super Tuesday, but Rubio has clearly lost his mojo, finishing behind Kasich in Maine and well behind Cruz in Kentucky and Louisiana. Rubio is running out of gas both metaphorically and physically. This is now a race between Cruz and Trump. I say this as a guy who a couple weeks ago endorse Rubio as the best chance to beat Trump. However, if I were Ted Cruz, I would be hoping that Marco Rubio does not drop out yet, at least not until after Thursday. Because the reason that Cruz was able to reach up and stun Donald Trump yesterday is that Rubio has picked apart Trumps vanity and caused him to self-immolate in a way that no candidate has been able to either before or since. Rubio was able to expose Trumps business record in a way that Cruz never was. Moreover, Rubios insult comic routine exposed what an ugly, shallow, insincere man Trump is to an electorate that was almost ready to embrace him as inevitable. Unfortunately, it also seems to have had the effect that it has destroyed Rubios chances at obtaining the nomination himself. Many voters who were horrified by Trumps response were equally horrified by Rubios behavior that provoked it.",0
"Title: Dont Believe Our Planet is Warming Up? Look At This!  Article: Many people, for some reason, refuse to believe that climate change is a real thing. With evidence mounting, we all need to get on the same page. Meteorologists in England began collecting weather statistics back in 1659 but it wasnt until 1873 that countries began sharing annual data through what is now known as the World Meteorological Organization. This is why officially the global record doesnt begin until 1880. The year 2016 was our hottest year since we began recording with average global land and water surface temperatures hitting 58.69 degrees Fahrenheit. That is around 2.69 degrees warmer than the twentieths century average. All but one of the sixteen hottest years in NASAs 134-year record have occurred since the year 2000. While this difference may not seem like much to most but it is. Records show that changes of this magnitude do not happen over a mere century leaving human fingerprints all over the temperature trend. Industry, as you know, boomed in the late 1800s sending new pollutants into the air. As a result of this carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have multiplied and are continuing to do so even today. Global warming is like riding up an escalator. Sure, these temperatures rise and fall but climate change is pushing the skyward no matter what. In the chart below you will see the numbers of years per decade that had above average temperature and how many of those years rose a half or whole degree above what was normal. You do not need a science degree to see that the average global temperature is rising. Our hottest years are getting hotter and something needs to be done.",0
"Title: Mr. ""I'm The Majority"" Mark Robinson Gives Epic Pro-Gun Speech  Article: You may remember Mark Robinson, aka Mr. ""I'm the Majority,"" whose comments to his city council in Greensboro, North Carolina who were considering unlawful actions to restrict the God-given rights of the people it is supposed to serve, went viral back in April. Just this past weekend, Robinson attended a pro-gun rally on Saturday that opposed the Communist ideology of David Hogg and his handlers at the Florida state capitol in Tallahassee. His epic speech has the same goal as the young people who were aligned with Hogg, the saving of our young people's lives, but his solution was a biblical, lawful and constitutional solution. Robinson has not changed his message since April. Back then he told his city council, It seems like every time we have one of these shootings, nobody wants to put the blame where it goes, which is at the shooters feet. You want to turn around and restrict my rightsYou want to restrict my right to buy a firearm and protect myself from some of the very people you are talking about in here tonight. The law abiding citizens of this community, of other communities we are the first ones taxed and the last ones considered. Im the majority, he added. Im a law-abiding citizen who has never shot anybody. Never committed a serious crime. Never committed a felony. Ive never done anything like that. It seems like every time we have one of these shootings, nobody wants to put the blame where it goes, which is at the shooters feet. You want to put it at my feet. You want to turn around and restrict my rights. take our poll - story continues below  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?
