"Title: Idea for the DK: Adopt a senator campaign.  Article: So my idea is a DKos campaign: Adopt a senator. This would certainly be for those of us who are in fairly safe blue areas, with reps very likely to be re-elected. But also for those who can take on more than a race or two at a time. I imagine the effort starting with a list of vulnerable democratic senate seats, as well as a list of democratic senatorial candidates running against incumbent republican senators. We put that out, and ask for adopters. The role of adopters would be to give money and time where they can. Hopefully, we might be able to have a running feature on this, with feed back from adopters telling us what they're doing for their new ""baby."" I want to note here, that if all anyone could give was a bit of money, that would be great. The idea is not to make the adopter feel weighed down by the responsibility. The idea is to put a chorus of angels behind our vulnerable democratic senators, and our democratic candidates that could do anything from donating, to phone canvassing, to getting to know that district and dropping good links in the appropriate places, or signing relevant petitions. Maybe the most you do as an adopter is show up on line on the pertinent sites and cheer lead. To each their own as to what they can give. I also wonder if the Dkos could partner with another progressive outlet, such as moveon or the Color of Change, to name just two, in promoting this campaign. I must be honest to say, I don't have the computer savvy to pull this off on my own, and I don't have the time to do so either.",0
"Title: Man emasculated after trying to use air compressor to enlarge his penis  Article: A man who tried to enlarge his genitals by inflating them with an air compressor was left completely emasculated and almost died after his penis exploded. 37-year old Ryan Davies, from Paterson in New Jersey, was lying unconscious in a pool of blood when his wife found him last night, so she immediately called the paramedics. He was rapidly transported to the hospital where he arrived in critical condition, but doctors were finally able to stabilize him after a few hours. Upon regaining consciousness, he admitted that he had tried everything to enlarge his penis over the last two years, and had already invested $15,000 in pills and penile pumps, without success. He finally decided to try his industrial air compressor, and he insists that his genitals did enlarge during the first few seconds before they literally exploded. I swear it couldve worked if Id left only a few seconds less Despite this partial success, he has now lost more than 90% of his genitals and may suffer from critical consequences for the rest of his life. This isnt the third accident involving makeshift penis enlargement devices this month in New Jersey, and authorities fear this could be the consequences of a new trend. Dr. Michael Hart, one of the most renowned penile surgeon in the world, says this kind of incident is bound to happen more often over the next few years as men become increasingly obsessed with the size of their genitals. There are always ridiculous new trends coming up, so people will keep doing stupid things and getting emasculated. Dr.",0
"Title: Catholic Bishops Love Mexico  Article: Americas Catholic bishops have asked all Americans to call Congress today, Monday, February 26, to demand amnesty for millions of illegal aliens. In a bishops-only letter of February 16, leaders of the national bishops conference urge their fellow bishops to ramp up their efforts because the urgency of this matter is now at its height. This is the most ambitious political campaign the bishops have launched in years. Whats going on? First, Catholic bishops like Mexico. Los Angeles Archbishop Jos Gmez is a leader in the bishops amnesty campaign. Born in Monterrey, he knows Mexico well. Like tens of millions of Mexican-Americans, he is still eligible to vote in Mexicos elections. But he wants millions of Mexican citizens now in the U.S. to be eligible to vote in our own elections as well. Why? Well, Gmez insists that Mexican immigrants have strong traditions of family and faith, community and hard work. Moreover, most are Catholic and hold deep conservative values. Thats why Gmez and his brother bishops oppose assimilation of Hispanics into broader American society. After all, bishops consider that society to be full of nativists, racists, xenophobes, and bigots. Assimilate? Why not just wait? After all, once some thirty to forty million more Hispanics become American citizens, he says, I know that together we will build an America that is stronger, more religious, and more moral. Of course, millions of new Hispanic Catholics will also fill the pews emptied by millions of Americas cradle Catholics who have left the Church during the past fifty years.",0
"Title: Can America Ever Come Together Again?  Article: Shop all books by Patrick Buchanan  If ex-CIA Director John Brennan did to Andrew Jackson what he did to Donald Trump, he would have lost a lot more than his security clearance. He would have been challenged to a duel and shot. Trumps  performance in Helsinki, Brennan had said, exceeds the threshold of high crimes & misdemeanors. It was  treasonous. Why should the president not strip from a CIA director who calls him a traitor the honor and privilege of a security clearance? Or is a top-secret clearance an entitlement like Social Security? CIA directors retain clearances because they are seen as national assets, individuals whose unique experience, knowledge and judgment may be called upon to assist a president in a national crisis. Nixonu2019s White Hous... Patrick J. Buchanan Best Price: $9.50 Buy New $9.00 (as of 06:20 EDT - Details)  Not so long ago, this was a bipartisan tradition. Who trashed this tradition? Was it not the former heads of the security agencies  CIA, FBI, director of national intelligence  who have been leveling the kind of savage attacks on the chief of state one might expect from antifa? Are ex-security officials entitled to retain the high privileges of the offices they held, if they descend into cable-TV hatred and hostility? Former CIA chief Mike Hayden, in attacking Trump for separating families of detained illegal immigrants at the border, tweeted a photo of the train tracks leading into Auschwitz. Other governments have separated mothers and children was Haydens caption. Is that fair criticism from an ex-CIA director? Thursday, The New York Times decried Trumps accusation that the media are the enemy of the people.",0
"Title: Is All Great Art Religious?  Article: In my last article for LRC I wrote about literature from the perspective of a somewhat educated abecedarian. I take solace that my opinions are not totally ridiculous by comparing my view of Madame Bovary (first developed about 25 years ago when I read the book) with that of George Sand (that I only recently read). Quoting myself, In Madame Bovary on the other hand, Emmas passions make her almost an evil person. In fact almost every character is nasty. The basic theme being that below the facade of bourgeois respectability lurks great evil. Thus in the end Emma kills herself and everyone is miserable. Here is what Sand wrote to Flaubert (CCCII. To Gustave Flaubert, in Paris Nohant, 12th January, 1876) about the realism of his writing. That desire to depict things as they are, the adventures of life as they present themselves to the eye, is not well thought out, in my opinion. Depict inert things as a realist, as a poet, its all the same to me, but, when one touches on the emotions of the human heart, it is another thing. You cannot abstract yourself from this contemplation; for man, that is yourself, and men, that is the reader. Whatever you do, your tale is a conversation between you and the reader. If you show him the evil coldly, without ever showing him the good he is angry. He wonders if it is he that is bad, or if it is you. You work, however, to rouse him and to interest him; you will never succeed if you are not roused yourself, or if you hide it so well that he thinks you indifferent. He is right: supreme impartiality is an anti-human thing, and a novel ought to be human above everything.",0
"Title: Not again Looks like McCain will get his bomb, bomb Iran after all  Article: Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. President Donald Trump is praising anti-government protesters in Iran and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley says the administration is intent on helping to amplify the voices of the Iranian people. This is a dance weve seen before. Where does it end? Well, probably with a big smile on Sen. John McCains face. Remember when the psychotic senator sang for a crowd, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran to the tune of the Beach Boys Barbara Ann at a 2007 campaign stop? Were getting close. Demonstrations kicking up across Iran are creating a perfect atmosphere for the Trump administration to jump into some good old fashioned democracy spreadin. Joy. As reported by The Washington Post:  The demonstrations, which started last week over frustrations about the economy but quickly shifted to political grievances, came two and a half months after Trump unveiled a new strategy to counter Iran and reverse what he sees as the Obama administrations lax approach. Later this month, Trump will have a chance to move beyond strong rhetoric when he is decides whether to certify that Iran is complying with the 2015 nuclear deal. But the protests are providing an earlier window into the administrations policies as it struggles to decide how to react to demonstrations that are evolving differently than the last big protests in Iran in 2009 over election fraud. At least initially, the two American presidents used similar language, including a key catchphrase. Trumps already taking the bait.",0
"Title: Oregon Man Arrested After Punching Convicted Sex Offender During Sentencing  Article: An Oregon man has now been arrested after he punched a convicted sex offender during his sentencing, but that's not all.

"Title: #MeToo: Female Sexual Assault Accuser Settles With Her Own Accuser Following Allegations of Sexual Assault  Article: OK, I know, settling with someone doesn't necessarily imply that the person is guilty. Sometimes it is simply to get it out of the media's sights, especially when you are in the spotlight. However, I find it ironic that Italian actress and #MeToo champion Asia Argento, who was one of the first to come forward and accuser movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, has now settled a sexual assault allegation brought against her for $380,000. The New York Times reports:  But in the months that followed her revelations about Mr. Weinstein last October, Ms. Argento quietly arranged to pay $380,000 to her own accuser: Jimmy Bennett, a young actor and rock musician who said she had sexually assaulted him in a California hotel room years earlier, when he was only two months past his 17th birthday. She was 37. The age of consent in California is 18. That claim and the subsequent arrangement for payments are laid out in documents between lawyers for Ms. Argento and Mr. Bennett, a former child actor who once played her son in a movie. The documents, which were sent to The New York Times through encrypted email by an unidentified party, include a selfie dated May 9, 2013, of the two lying in bed. As part of the agreement, Mr. Bennett, who is now 22, gave the photograph and its copyright to Ms. Argento, now 42. Three people familiar with the case said the documents were authentic. The Times has tried repeatedly since Thursday to get a response to the matter from Ms. Argento and her representatives. She did not reply to messages left on her phone, sent by email and sent to two of her agents, who agreed to forward it to her.",1
"Title: MSNBC's Chris Matthews Obliterates Paranoid Trump, Calls Him A ""Weirdo In The Basement"" %%  Article: MSNBCs Chris Matthews pulled no punches on Thursday, slamming Donald Trump for his repeated lies and offering harsh words for those who bend over backward to defend the president when he does or says something flatly untrue. Matthews said, The man in the White House is demonstrably capable of making up claims that have no reality. Video: Matthews said: Tomorrows Friday. If the president were to rise at dawn and say, Its Saturday, what would be the meaning of that statement? Would his people  those who back him no matter what  check their calendars and convince themselves the calendar theyve been using is wrong and the leader they adore is right? This whole thing about President Obama wiretapping Trump is nothing but trumped up nonsense  The man in the White House is demonstrably capable of making up claims that have no reality. Hes no better than the weirdo in the basement who calls in the fire alarm just to hear the sirens go past. The MSNBC host isnt right about everything, but on this, he is spot on. Not only is Trumps latest claim about President Obama ludicrous, but its just the latest in his long history of perpetuating complete falsehoods. Worse is that those who work for him in the White House and the Americans who support him will defend him at all costs. Trumps claims about Barack Obama are no different than him waking up tomorrow and claiming its not Friday, but instead its whatever day he chooses it to be. Up is down, left is right, Fox News is fair and balanced. To the new administration, reality is no longer a concrete, indisputable thing  its whatever Trump says it is.",0
"Title: NASA scientists confirm the reception of a message from God  Article: A team of astrophysicists linked to the University of California has announced this morning that one of the radio telescopes they use to search for extraterrestrial intelligence intercepted a transmission which they believe could be a message from God himself. The scientists, directed by Professor Dan Werthimer, are part of the SERENDIP (Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations) project, a program that attempts to intercept and decode radio transmissions from outer space. They announced that the Arecibo radio telescope, located in Puerto Rico, received on Saturday afternoon, a strong narrowband radio signal bearing the expected hallmarks of a non-terrestrial communication, originating from outside the solar system. The signal is said to be very similar to the famous Wow! signal received on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State Universitys Big Ear radio telescope. However, while the Wow! signal represented an incomprehensible series of letters and numbers, namely 6EQUJ5, this new signal spells a long series of 29 letters which spell five words in the ancient Hebraic language. According to the scientists who intercepted it, the message is surprisingly clear. The message can be translated as either I am Yahweh, Universal Creator or My name is Yahweh, Creator of the Universe.",0
"Title: Mix It Up Prom Acclaimed As Huge Success  Article: By Julia Stanton At Progressive Valley Elementary School in Montgomery Washington, the summer school held its first Mix It Up Prom. Traditionally summer schools have not had proms, however progressive educators and activists decided to organize an especially meaningful one. What made this prom unique is that it encouraged students to look outside of their narrow racial or sexual orientation box and to take a step into a much larger and more diverse world. The Mix it up Prom encouraged white girls to go with African-American boys, and white boys to go with other boys. For many young men, it provided their first opportunity to begin to experiment with same-sex dating. For many young ladies, the event served to help them begin several especially meaningful relationships with young men of another race. This type of dating is absolutely necessary if we are to move forward into the next century, and if the United States is to become a full participant in the global community. Diverse relationships, whether they cross racial lines or sexual orientation lines are key to combating stereotypes, prejudice, and racial or sexual hatred. For that reason, some progressives have suggested mandating interracial marriage by law, in order to ensure that within just a few generations all Americans are of the same race, and the problem of racial prejudice is destroyed forever. Moderate progressives have suggested that whites simply should not have children at all, in order to help end racism, and should adopt babies from Africa instead.",1
"Title: Communists and Socialists Embedded In Our Government!  Article: Has anyone ever wondered if we had Communists and Socialists working within our government to destroy our nation? We have found in plain sight many people with deep connections to both of these groups working within our Congress making laws that may well lead to becoming either a Socialist or Communist state. Let us begin with the Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Rep. Nancy Pelosi. Now, people will say this is crazy but if you dig deep enough you will see what we lay claim to here, but this is just the beginning as we will also show others with the same type of ideas and ones that are seen regularly. Nancy Pelosi (See-http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=1248)  On November 11 1995, Pelosi and fellow Democratic Congressman Ron Dellums were the keynote speakers at a public hearing on jobs and economic insecurity in San Francisco. The event was co-sponsored by the San Francisco Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and the Full Employment Coalition. In the 1996 Congressional elections, the DSA's Political Action Committee endorsed Pelosi's candidacy. I pride myself in being called a liberal, Pelosi said that year. ... I dont consider myself a moderate. [7] In 1997 Pelosi co-sponsored Congressman Matthew Martinez's Job Creation and Infrastructure Restoration Act, which proposed to use $250 billion in federal funds for the establishment of union-wage jobs rebuilding infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, libraries, public transportation, highways, and parks).",1
"Title: Is My (NH Democratic) Party Breaking the Law?  Article: The law could not be more clear about this requirement. Here is the relevant part: Only contributions meeting any of the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section may be deposited in a Federal account established under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, see 11 CFR 103.3, or may be received by a political committee established under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section: (i) Contributions designated for the Federal account; (ii) Contributions that result from a solicitation which expressly states that the contribution will be used in connection with a Federal election; or (iii) Contributions from contributors who are informed that all contributions are subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act. Is it common practice for the state Democratic and Republican parties in the other 49 states to not report donations to their secretary of state's offices? Is it common for them to ignore the law which requires that they disclose to donors when a check will be deposited into a ""Federal"" account? Here in New Hampshire, Democrats lost more than 15 house seats in a year when the rest of the nation turned bluer. Perhaps if some of that money had not gone into a ""Federal"" account, and had instead gone into helping State candidates things would be different. Most Democratic legislators agree, we would probably have passed legislation that offered property tax relief (i.e. an income tax) and would have abolished the death penalty if we had 15 more Democrats sitting in the House this biennium. This improper fundraising practice allows an oligarchy, instead of the State Committee, to decide on whom the money will be spent.",0
"Title: Donald Trump Signs Anti-Abortion Executive Order  Article: On Monday President Trump signed three executive orders, one of which has the whole United States angry. Trump first signed an executive order formally ending the United States participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, fulfilling one of his core campaign promises. He also signed one freezing federal hiring, and lastly, an executive action to limit abortion funding overseas. Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy, also known as the global gag rule, which was first put in place by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. The action prohibits giving U.S. funding to international nongovernmental organizations that offer or advise on a wide range of family planning and reproductive health options if they include abortion. Annually, the United States spends about $$600 million on international assistance for family planning and reproductive health programs. The regulation has been something of a political football, instituted by Republican administrations and rescinded by Democratic ones since 1984. Most recently, President Barack Obama ended the ban in 2009. Trump signed it one day after the Jan. 22 anniversary of the Supreme Courts 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion in the United States, the date which is traditionally when presidents take action on the policy. The policy also prohibits taxpayer funding for groups that lobby to legalize abortion or promote it as a family planning method. This policy forbids foreign nongovernmental organizations that receive federal funding from performing or promoting abortion services through their work in other countries.",0
"Title: Student radio host says tranny on air gets a lesson in liberal censorship (video)  Article: A University of Minnesota-Morris student radio host was thrown off the air and confronted by police when he used the word tranny during an on-air discussion about Antifa violence. UMM student Brandon Albrecht and co-host Taylor Lehmann were discussing the lack of Antifa style violence at their university on a recent episode of their show, Deplorable Radio, when Albrechts remark drew the ire of an unnamed individual who reportedly serves as the station manager. The manager falsely claimed that tranny is hate speech which cant be said on-air because of FCC rules. Heres a report on the incident via The College Fix:  Deplorable Radio is a weekly show on KUMM hosted by students Brandon Albrecht and Tayler Lehmann. Albrecht told The College Fix in an email that the programming is a mix of politics, music, and some random musings about current events locally and around the world. The duo was notified of the cancellation two weeks ago after Albrecht used a controversial word on-air to refer to transgender individuals. During a discussion about the universitys lack of Antifa violence, Albrecht said the campus was too small for a potential violent activist to hide his identity. You know, you can definitely, you see one tranny thats trying to punch someone, Albrecht told The Fix he said on-air. You know its automatically that one guy that you know Im talking about. I bet you know. Im not going to dox anybody and name them on air. But you two know if I say the tranny who looks like hes going to punch someone. Yep. About fifteen minutes later, Albrecht told The Fix, the student station manager came into the studio with a UMMPD officer and told us to leave.",1
"Title: Quebec Enjoying Mini-Baby Boom but is it Enough to Halt Demographic Decline?  Article: News By Hilary White MONTREAL, November 8, 2007 (LifeSiteNews.com)  After decades of suffering the lowest birth rate in North America, Quebec is enjoying a mini baby boom the Globe and Mail has reported. According to data from the provinces Institute de la Statistique, Quebec has seen an increase in the birth rate of 9 per cent between 2005 and 2006. This year, the statistics show almost 1,000 more births between April and June 2007, than in the same period last year. It is not the first time that such increases have been recorded, however, and Quebecs birth rate still remains well below replacement level. In 2001 a University of Toronto economist, Kevin Milligan, found that Quebecs birth rate rose during a nine-year baby bonus program that ended in 1997. He said the bonuses caused a 10 per cent increase in births by first-time mothers, 13 per cent for mothers who already had one child, and 25 per cent for those with two or more children. The program offered $500 for a first baby and up to $8,000 over five years for three or more births. But even with these increases, Quebecs birth rate in 1997 was one of the lowest in the world, at approximately 1.5 children per couple. Meanwhile, the number of abortions in Quebec doubled from 1980 to 2000. According to the most recent available statistics, Canadas overall fertility rate stands far below replacement level at 1.61 children born per woman. In 1998 the Institute de la Statistique showed 38 abortions per 100 live births in the province.",0
"Title: Woman drugged her ex-boyfriend and tattooed her face all over him  Article: Cincinnati, OH | An Ohio man that was being stalked for months by his ex-girlfriend claims she drugged him and tattooed him while he was unconscious. Andrew Whitmore, 44, woke up in incredible pain and soaked in blood in his exs apartment and realized only moments later what had really happened. He had been drugged and his ex-girlfriend had tattooed her face all over his chest, arms, legs, back, posterior and even on his genitals. She even tattooed her face on my dick, he told reporters in shock. I cant even go pee without seeing her face on my dick and balls, he said in disbelief. She kept screaming, no one will ever want to sleep with you again. You are mine, mine!!! he recalls. Dropped charges Weirdly enough, Whitmore did not file any complaint against his ex-girlfriend who reportedly tattooed her face on his body 77 times, and the couple has even started dating again. Overall, I kind of felt guilty over the whole deal. Im the one who cheated on her like forty times and got her hooked on crystal meth and crack cocaine. And now that Im tattooed with her face all over my body, ass cheeks and genitals, seriously, would anybody else want to hook up with me? he said jokingly. I mean, at the end, a vagina is a vagina, and women are basically all crazy, so why not stick around with her? he said with humor. What worse thing could happen?",0

"Title: Jahi McMath may be past the point of recovery as her condition deteriorates, family says  Article: NewsEnd of Life January 8, 2014 (LifeSiteNews.com)  The body of 13-year-old Jahi McMath may have so deteriorated in the 25 days since she was declared brain dead that it may be impossible for her to recover, her family's attorney said today. On December 8, Jahi McMath experienced severe complications from a tonsillectomy at Children's Hospital in Oakland, California, and fell into a coma. Doctors declared her brain dead on December 12. I want her on [the ventilator] as long as possible, because I really believe that God will wake her up, her mother, Nailah Winkfield, said. But in California a person is considered deceased the moment he or she is declared brain dead. Hospital attorney Douglas Straus said flatly that the hospital would not perform medical procedures on the body of a deceased human being. The decision generated nationwide sympathy for the young girl and her family. The Terri Schiavo Life and Hope Network (Terris Network) joined the battle, issuing a statement last Tuesday that the child retains all the functional attributes of a living person, despite her brain injury. This includes a beating heart, circulation and respiration, the ability to metabolize nutrition and more. Jahi is a living human being. Last Friday, California's Alameda County Superior Court granted the family the right to remove their daughter from Children's Hospital.",0
"Title: Orange Crushed: John Boehner Melts Down After President Obama Vetoes Keystone XL %%  Article: Speaker of the House John Boehner could only react with inept rage after President Obama vetoed Keystone XL. In a statement, Boehner raged: The presidents veto of the Keystone jobs bill is a national embarrassment. Its embarrassing when Russia and China are plowing ahead on two massive pipelines and we cant get this one no-brainer of a project off the ground. The president is just too close to environmental extremists to stand up for Americas workers. Hes too invested in left-fringe politics to do what presidents are called on to do, and thats put the national interest first. For the president, Keystone may just be todays politics, but there are workers and unions who have spent years counting on the 42,000 jobs this project will support. There are small business owners counting on the promise and opportunities this project will bring to their towns. There are governors in both parties counting on the revenue and growth this project will bring to their states. There are manufacturers clamoring for the development of North Americas resources. And theres an overwhelming majority of Americans who want us to put politics aside and get this done. Everyone who pays attention to politics understood that the Republican obsession with Keystone XL was a total waste of time. It is interesting that Boehner considers the veto of the pipeline a national embarrassment when he doesnt feel the same way about the government shutdown that he spearheaded, the various debt ceiling debacles, the invasion of Iraq based on a lie that he supported, and House of Representatives that spends more time on vacation than passing laws. The national embarrassment is John Boehner.",1
"Title: Is Michael Snyder The Most Pro-Trump Candidate For Congress In The Entire Country?  Article: This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse  The 2018 mid-term elections are going to be all about Donald Trump, and Republican candidates all over the nation need to make it clear where they stand. Either you are with Trump and want to support his agenda, or you are running for Congress for some other reason. Personally, I am making it exceedingly clear where I stand. My new campaign signs have Vote Pro-Trump emblazoned right across the top, and the first thing that visitors to my campaign website see is a pro-Trump slogan. Trump supporters all over Idaho are pouring into our campaign, and many of them are extremely enthusiastic. In fact, one of our supporters made some incredibly funny modifications to our new campaign sign, and you can see his work right here. When Meranda saw that, she literally couldnt stop laughing. And without a doubt that meme is quite over the top, but it just illustrates how people are feeling about our campaign. I believe that any Republican that is running for Congress should be unashamedly pro-Trump, and I dont understand those that are trying to distance themselves from the president. Here in Idaho, a number of my opponents have absolutely no intention of helping Donald Trump once they get into office, and that is why it is so imperative that we win this race. With less than four months to go, the numbers tell us that it is an extremely close race and up to two-thirds of the voters are still completely undecided. We need your financial support to help reach those undecided voters, and if you would like to help, you can donate online right here.",0
"Title: Republicans Fooled Americans Again To Eliminate Womens Reproductive Rights  Article: Most Americans are familiar with the adage, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. Unfortunately, even though Americans are aware they were fooled in the 2010 midterm elections, particularly American women, they were fooled again and gave Republicans control of Congress. It is the epitome of Einsteins famous quote that insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome. It is also the epitome of stupid and if nothing else, the results of the 2014 midterms revealed that for the most part Americans are inherently stupid people. In the lead up to the 2014 midterms, exactly like the 2010 midterms, Republicans pledged that if they won control of Congress, they would focus on jobs and growing the economy. In fact, the day Mitch McConnell was sworn in as Senate Majority Leader, he had the temerity to say that now Serious adults are in charge here, and we intend to make progress. The House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), openly stated that Were focused on job creation and running a more efficient, effective, accountable government. That stated focus was a lie, but that is what Republicans are known for and yet Americans elected them anyway. Both McCarthy and McConnells assertions sounded precisely like Republicans in 2011 when they took control of the House, and yet the first items on their agenda besides taking steps to slash Social Security, give the Kochs and John Boehner a pipeline gift, were attacks on womens reproductive rights. (Continued Below) Not only are Republicans not adults or focused on job creation or the least bit concerned about running a more efficient government, they are dirty liars.",1
"Title: Have the Democrats Introduced an Immigration Overton Window Scenario?  Article: Conservatives constantly complain about a lack of transparency in Washington, and for good reason. Just look at the Mueller investigation, the FBI and FISA. But on at least one issue, things are as transparent as they can be. This issue is immigration and the transparency is John McCain's white-hot hatred of Donald Trump. McCain will not miss a single opportunity to stick a finger in the eye of Trump, regardless of the damage to his Party and especially the nation. And so it is yet again as the great Maverick of the Senate, John McCain, joined forces with demDemocratris Coons to introduce their own bipartisan immigration proposal. Bipartisan is supposed to mean working together and compromising, when needed, for the good of the whole. Yet we should know by now, bipartisan in Washington bears no resemblance to the real world. D.C. bipartisanship means only that Republicans cave to the immediate demands of democrats, trusting the untrustworthy dems to follow through with whatever vague promise they make of maybe giving the right a little of what they want later. And we also know that later never comes. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) formally introduced a bill that would grant permanent legal status to undocumented immigrants known as dreamers and start bolstering security along the U.S.-Mexico border. But the measure would not immediately authorize spending the $25 billion President Trump is seeking to fortify the border with new wall and fence construction, writes the Washington Post, and I'm sure gleefully so.",1
"Title: How is Trump Supposed To Negotiate Immigration When His Opponents Are Constantly Calling Him A ""Racist""?  Article: Once upon a time, it wasnt okay to smear your political opponent with something like racist or bigot without first showing some evidence. Sadly, in todays America, these words get thrown around as if they have no meaning and as if everyone can agree to their usage. The latest example comes to us through the immigration debate where the left and the media continue to attack the President for supposedly calling some 3rd world nation(s) sh**holes, something the President denies ever saying (and several of the people in the meeting have backed him up on this point). Heres the problem, while the Presidents language may be vulgar and his word choice poor, its a sentiment that most Americans agree with, and its at the heart of a larger debate about how we choose migrants to accept into our nation. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) made a similar argument while defending the President from his detractors, on NBCs Meet the Press when he asked how the President is supposed to negotiate on DACA and illegal immigration if his opponents are all calling him a racist. Its as if the left doesnt actually want to negotiate a compromise, they simply want to smear the President and make compromise impossible. Rand Paul: I dont think the comments were constructive at all. But I also think that to be fair, we shouldnt draw conclusions that he didnt intend. I know personally about his feelings towards Haiti and towards Central America because when I was not a candidate for president and he wasnt a candidate for president, I went down there on a medical mission trip. I did about 200 cataract surgeries with a group of surgeons in Haiti and the same in Central America.",1
"Title: The Trump Collusion Conspiracy Theory Falls Apart  Article: Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. Robert Mueller was appointed to investigate Russian collusion back in May. A new year is upon us. The warm May temperatures have been replaced by a deep freeze and snow is falling in Tallahassee. But after blowing through around $7 million and putting on an exciting show of surprise raids, gag orders, leaks and the varying pleas and indictments; Mueller still hasnt produced a single collusion indictment. Its much easier to pick Manaforts lock than to prove Hillary Clintons conspiracy theory. What Mueller did was harass a bunch of already shady characters into pleading guilty on minor charges, some, like lying to the FBI, created by his own investigation. All he had to do was get his team of Obama and Clinton supporters in front of Obama and Clinton judges who would rubber stamp anything. And the grand jury allegedly looked like a Bernie Sanders or Black Lives Matter rally with some participants wearing left-wing shirts. There wasnt a single white male among the 20 jurors. Thats a convenient way to screen out likely Trump supporters and bring in likely Trump opponents. Blatantly rigging it to a low bar is an admission by Mueller and his team that their case is too weak for prime time. Even now Manafort is suing the DOJ. His lawsuit may go nowhere, but the odds are good that Muellers tactics and evidence wont stand up to serious scrutiny. Thats what happened with key Mueller team member Andrew Weissmanns assault on Arthur Andersen.",1
"Title: Major Escalation: Israel Carries Out Large Scale Attack On Syria After Israeli F-16 Shot Down  Article: Update: According to Al Masdar, the Israeli pilot whose warplane was shot down by Syrian air defense forces on Saturday morning has died from injuries sustained during the engagement. While according to initial reports both crew members ejected  the weapons operator with light injuries and the pilot with severe injuries, according to subsequent, still unconfirmed, reports, the Israeli pilot with serious injuries has died in hospital. No further details were given according to Al Masdar. This report however is being denied by the Times of Israel which reported that the pilot suffered wounds to chest, abdomen while ejecting from jet; co-pilot set to be released home Sunday. The condition of the pilot, who was seriously injured after he was forced to evacuate the plane, stabilized Saturday morning, but he was still unconscious and connected to a respirator, doctors at Haifas Rambam Medical Center said. The condition of a seriously wounded Israeli pilot began to improve Saturday, after he underwent surgery for injuries he sustained while ejecting from his plane over northern Israel, in the midst of a severe confrontation between Israel, Syria, and Iran, the ToI reported. The F-16 jet he was piloting took part in Israeli airstrikes in response to an Iranian drone that entered Israeli airspace from Syria in the early morning hours on Saturday. | :          @OrHeller @alonbd pic.twitter.com/SjF0QWIpli    (@news10) February 10, 2018  As reported earlier (see below), a major battle broke out on Saturday between the Israeli Air Force and Syrian Air Defence Force over the occupied Golan Region, south Lebanon and the west Damascus region.",1
"Title: Bigger than Jesus? How Rock and Roll and the Beatles Supplanted Christianity and Destroyed the West  Article: And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. - Mark 3:25  Over at First Things, one of the last redoubts of Catholic neoconservativism, John Waters has a curious article, How U2 betrayed Rock and Roll, arguing that the Irish quartet of aging rockers recent support of the yes vote in the Irish referendum on abortion is the unfortunate culmination of the bands spiritual and musical degeneration throughout the 90s and 2000s. However, Waters critique is followed by an odd affirmation that the Dubliner rockers, who had identified with Christianity off and on in their careers, were once a sincere and thoughtful group, concerned with the noble task of truth-telling. In fact, Waters even argues further that rock and roll is at least rooted in the authentic, nay even Christian spirituality of the singing of black slaves in the antebellum American Southalthough Waters does admit that the relationship between Christ and rock n roll is paradoxical at best. While Waters is correct in his deserved praise of the aesthetic quality of U2s music, he errs in his assessment of rock and rolls allegedly noble roots. Despite obvious precedence in Gospel-infused songs sung by slaves as well as in European ballads possibly dating back to the Paleolithic period, rock and roll has always been evil. At risk of reviving the Satanic Panic of the 1980s, it must be noted that there is no more relation between Christ and rock and roll than there is between Christ and Satan.",0
"Title: DNA Evidence Exonerates Edward Thompson Confessed Serial Murderer And Rapist, Thompson States I Took The Blame So African-American Youths Wouldnt Be Punished!  Article: By Werombi Towradji After spending nearly 35 years behind bars in a federal prison, recently analyzed DNA evidence has exonerated confessed serial murderer and rapist Edward Thompson. The evidence proves conclusively that the crimes for which he took responsibility were, in fact, committed by African-Americans. Thompson, a white male, who is 58 now, was serving eight consecutive life sentences. One for each victim. In a trial that lasted several months, prosecutors showed the jury pictures of brutally beaten, raped, tortured, and murdered young women. For years Thompson was regarded as one of Americas most heinous serial killers, and his story was profiled extensively by the media. Many Americans were puzzled as to why a young white American, who was by all accounts a great student, from a wealthy and upper class family, would go into urban neighbourhoods and brutally rape and murder young white women. His family and friends expressed disbelief, yet in court, he confessed guilt and even orated at length as to how much he enjoyed planning and carrying out his horrific crimes. It was all, we know now, a carefully contrived act. Upon his release, reporters asked Thompson, Why did you accept guilt for such heinous and gruesome crimes when you were innocent? Why did you keep silent for so many years, and remain in prison? Thompson answered I knew that most likely these crimes were going to be traced to urban youths of color. I didnt want African-American boys, who grew up facing the sting of poverty and bigotry everyday of their lives, to go to jail for raping and killing a series of privileged and affluent white women. The truth is we are all guilty.",0
"Title: Video report confirms Egyptian crucifixions  Article: An Arabic-language video news report from Abu Dhabi-based Sky News Arabia confirms a WND story about the latest method of attack on Christians in Egypt: crucifixions. The story went viral over the weekend, but today columnist Jonathan Kay at Canadas National Post described it as a hoax and an instant Internet myth. It is, of course, theoretically possible that Muslim radicals truly have crucified someone, somewhere, sometime, in Egypt. Islamist mobs have staged countless murderous attacks on Copt infidels in recent years  and a crucifixion would hardly be more barbarous tactic than truck bombs and beheadings, he wrote. But the story doesnt just allege that a crucifixion has taken place somewhere in Egypt, he added: It alleges that multiple crucifixions have taken place in front of the presidential palace. That would be the equivalent of, say, mass lynchings taking place in front of the White House, or a giant gang rape taking place in front of Ottawas Centennial Flame fountain. Most damning, according to Kays column, is that one of the key sources cited by WND for the story  an Arabic-language report by Sky News  doesnt exist. There is no Sky report on the subject, he wrote. Except there is.",0
"Title: San Francisco afraid to enforce buffer zone ordinance; Planned Parenthood ticked  Article: The PulseAbortion, Freedom In the aftermath of the Supreme Courts June 26 decision striking down Massachusetts 35-foot buffer zone law, the City of San Francisco has become squishy about enforcing its buffer zone ordinance, ticking off Planned Parenthood in the process. San Franciscos ordinance, which bans abortion opponents from entering a 25-foot line of demarcation around abortion clinics, is virtually identical to Massachusetts now voided law, minus 10 feet. Now, San Francisco pro-life activists are allegedly feeling their oats and defying the ordinance by crossing the line. Meanwhile, city attorneys are rightfully worried that enforcing the ordinance will draw pro-life ire and a lawsuit. So theyve chosen instead to withstand pro-abortion ire by ignoring the pro-life provocateurs, which has resulted in a letter of complaint from Planned Parenthood. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, July 27: Planned Parenthood executives say San Francisco police and the city attorney arent doing enough to protect patients and staff from harassment and intimidation at the organizations health center on Valencia Street [pictured above]. Each week, as the harassment and intimidation escalate the citys ordinances are violated ever more flagrantly, Planned Parenthoods Bay Area chapter leader, Heather Saunders Estes,wrote in a July 22 letter to City Attorney Dennis Herrera. And when center staffers call police, they are told that there is nothing they can do, Saunders Estes wrote. The protesters now ignore San Franciscos 25-foot buffer zone as they pass out literature, and film staffers and patients entering the building, clinic reps complain.",0
"Title: Obama Urges Us to Stop Resisting Globalization  Article: For many years, there has been a push toward a global community. This has had its benefits and its drawbacks. In the mind of the Intelligentsia, this would eventually work out world peace. As countries traded with one another and companies worked internationally, there would be greater interest for both politicians and businessmen to see the end of conflicts. At the same time, we have seen those traditionally the leaders in manufacturing, America and Britain, are suffering the loss of jobs. One of the main reason is the government: U.S. EPA and EU have made these traditional titans hamstrung in international markets. But this is also by design, as globalists know that these companies will not break with their national employees without financial pain pushing them to do so. Now, as Britain is pushing back against EU forced Islamic Invasion and the rise of Trump in this political season continues, it is becoming clear that this is not something that Americans and Brits are going to take lying down. To answer this, Obama has warned that there is no use in resisting the tide. Breitbart reports: President Barack Obama warns critics of globalization that the international economy is here to stay and that many jobs lost in the United States are not coming back. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Obama said that globalization and automation would continue to grow and urged older workers to stop resisting change. The reason for the generation gap is actually the older workers' fault.",0
"Title: Islamic Terrorists and Gay Targets  Article: Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. A few days before the second anniversary of the Pulse massacre in Orlando, Florida, two Muslim terrorists were arrested in a plot to attack gay targets in France. There may be no connection beyond coincidence, but the media would have normally made one anyway if it werent avoiding the subject. The aftermath of Omar Mateens killing spree was one of the modern medias low points. And these days thats a competitively low bar. Cable news ignored Omars declaration that he was an Islamic terrorist and instead wildly speculated that he was secretly gay and homophobic at the same time. Its been established conclusively that the ISIS terrorist wasnt gay. He may not have even known that he was about to open fire in a gay nightclub. His original target had been the Disney Springs mall. And his message began with, In the name of Allah. ISIS has recorded propaganda videos of its fighters fully implementing Sharia law by hurling gay men off buildings. But after the medias misleading coverage, it appeared to urge future attackers to avoid targets where their intentions might be misinterpreted. ISIS had managed to pull of its deadliest attack in America only to have it be attributed to repressed homosexuality instead of the glorious caliphate. A year later, Amer Alhaggagi was indicted for aiding ISIS and plotting murderous terror attacks. 'I'm going to place a bomb in a gay club, Wallah or by Allah,' he allegedly said.",1
"Title: Trump: ""I'd Love to See a Shutdown""  Article: So, here we are again, just like I said we would be after last month's ""crisis"" of a government shutdown. President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday, ""I'd love to see a shutdown"" if Democrats will not accept his immigration proposals. Some of the proposals from Trump is to eliminate ""chain migration"" and alter immigration law to cut off the flow of MS-13 gang members into the US. Additionally, part of a Trump deal is to get $18 billion in funding for a southern border wall, as well as more military funding. ""If they don't want to take care of our military then shut it down,"" Trump said. ""We need much better border mechanisms and much better border security. We need the wall. We're going to get the wall,"" the president added. ""If we don't have the wall, we're never going to solve this problem."" Earlier Tuesday, Trump tweeted out a Daily Caller article which claimed a majority of Americans support a DACA compromise. The article also claims that it would fully strengthen the border and also include immigration laws changes. ""Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA, fully secures the border, ends chain migration & cancels the visa lottery,"" tweeted Trump. ""If Ds oppose this deal, they arent serious about DACA-they just want open borders.""

"Title: Islamists with Ties to Terror Lobby Congress  Article: For the past three years, Islamists with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and terrorist groups have come to Capitol Hill to lobby members of Congress on National Muslim Advocacy Day, an annual event organized by Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO). At last years lobby day, according to the Muslim Advocacy Day website, almost 400 participants visited congressional offices. I have now published a detailed report at the Middle East Forum that profiles the Islamist activists and officials involved with this lobbying effort, and who have previously met with members of Congress and their staffers. Some of these officials are directly linked to terrorists. Others have invited prominent Islamist extremists into American mosques: providing venues for them to spread their message of hate; funneling money to their networks; and using social media to publicize and encourage their activities. Some examples of these prominent terror-linked Islamist leaders who have participated in Muslim Advocacy Day include:  1. Oussama Jammal is the secretary general of US Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO), a coalition of American-Muslim organizations that hosts the Muslim Adovcacy Day. Jammal is also the director of the Muslim American Society - Public Affairs and Civic Engagement (MAS-PACE), a division of the Muslim American Society (MAS), which has been identified in court testimony as a front group for the Muslim Brotherhood. Jammal is also the vice president of the Mosque Foundation in Bridgeview.",1
"Title: Erdogan to US: Get out of the way so we can kill Kurds  Article: Over the weekend, the killing began in earnest. Turkey used its U.S.-supplied fighter jets to bomb more than one hundred targets in the predominantly Kurdish province of Afrin in Northern Syria on Saturday, killing civilians and YPG fighters alike. On Sunday, Turkish ground troops crossed the border, invading Syria. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has made his intentions abundantly clear, vowing repeatedly to crush the Kurdish-led democratic government in Afrin, on Turkeys southern border. But it was Erdogans threats last week to U.S. troops serving as advisors to Kurdish fighters in northern Syria that were the real show stopper. ""This is what we have to say to all our allies: don't get in between us and terrorist organizations, or we will not be responsible for the unwanted consequences,"" Erdogan said in a speech in Ankara. ""Either you take off your flags on those terrorist organizations, or we will have to hand those flags over to you, Don't force us to bury in the ground those who are with terrorists,"" he said. In other words, Get out of the way, or you die. Erdogan was ostensibly responding to a statement from a U.S. military spokesman a few days earlier, who revealed that the U.S. was working with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to establish and train the new Syrian Border Security Force. The inaugural class of the new border security force, currently in training, was just 230 persons. But the goal was a final force size of approximately 30,000, the spokesman said. When he heard that, Erdogan went ballistic, absolutely insane.",0
"Title: Take a ride on the crazy train  Article: A state of war exists when there is declared or undeclared military conflict. But this is not the only war. A state of war exists when oppressive authority under color of law and seductive persuasion gradually diminishes our natural rights to life, liberty and property. Today we live in a state of war with the U.S. government. The fact that almost no one is aware is a tribute to the deceptiveness of our political process. Why do most people not feel the oppression of government in spite of so many things that look so obvious to some of us? I can give you one answer and I believe it to be true: The more dependent one is on government authority, the less likely he is to see government and its politicians as an adversary. Another answer is the power that government and its change agents have to manipulate language and stoke class, race and political warfare in order to redirect animus away from government. And if you watch carefully you will see that the government and political class change sides on the issues as they ebb and flow in the national discourse. Thats because the only side the government and political class is on is their own side. And its opposite the peoples side. Nowhere is this more evident than the new debate over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the evil stepchild of the Department of Homeland Security. ICE was formed in 2003 in the aftermath of 9/11 as one of the myriad liberty-stealing laws and government agencies created ostensibly to keep us safe. Keep us safe is one of the many code words politicians and other government men use to oppress us.",1
"Title: Brutal Attack Stopped  Article: The AR-15 is the most demonized firearm in the world these days (or at least in the United States). While gun folks tend to love the blasted thingsyours truly includedanti-gunners see them as basically magazine-fed bazookas. Thanks to the media, which has misrepresented the weapons to the public at large, most people seem to think theyre the most deadly firearms out there. As a result, most folks look at the rifles with something like disgust following the tragedy in Parkland, FL. Yet its important to remember that the rifles arent inherently good or evil. Theyre just tools that can be used for evil, like in Parkland. They can also be used for good, like in this case from Illinois:  OSWEGO TOWNSHIP, IL  A witness used an AR-15 rifle to stop a knife attack Monday in the 100 block of Harbor Drive, the Kendall County Sheriffs Office said. According to police, deputies responded to a report of one person with a knife and another with a gun at the Oswego Township apartment complex. An investigation revealed the incident began as a neighbor dispute, with the suspect inflicting multiple stab wounds on the victim, a 28-year-old man. On Tuesday evening, the Kendall County Sheriffs Office said two people  a 19-year-old Naperville woman and a 22-year-old Oswego man  have been charged with aggravated battery and mob action, both felonies, in connection with the incident.

"Title: St. Cloud, MN: Site of Jihad Attack by Muslim Migrant Rejects Resolution Calling for Moratorium on Immigration  Article: Muslim migrant Dahir Adan went on a stabbing spree at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota in September 2016. Dressed in a private security uniform, Adan yelled Islam, Islam and Allahu akbar, as well as asking several people whether they were Muslim before stabbing them during the Sept. 17 attack. This was signature jihad  we have seen jihadis separate Muslim from non-Muslims during the attacks at the Oberoi Trident hotel, the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower in Mumbai, at the Westgate in Nairobi, the beach resort in Tunisia, the gas complex attack in Algeria, etc. A little over a year later, the City Council of the same city, St. Cloud, Minnesota, rejected a moratorium on immigration. They already suffered a jihad attack by a Muslim migrant, but it did not teach them anything. They still either dont know or dont care that it is impossible to distinguish jihadi Muslims from peaceful Muslim refugees. They either dont know or dont care that any Muslim who reads and believes the Qurans verses about making war against and killing unbelievers could go jihad at any time. To be concerned about such things is islamophobic. St. Clouds City Council either doesnt know or doesnt care that the kind of jihad attack that Dahir Adan perpetrated in their city last year could happen again. And so it will. St. Cloud rejects resolution calling for moratorium on immigration, by Kelly Smith, Star Tribune, November 7, 2017:  ST.

The event will be organized by Free Radicals, which is described as a Los Angeles-based feminist and anti-racist community organization of scientists[.] The organization aims to incorporate a critical social justice lens into science by way of an interactive workshop on feminist research and engineering practices. According to a description of the event, Justice provides a framework for scientists to think through the hidden assumptions in their methodological approaches, and challenges researchers to think more deeply about the political implications of their work. At the Feminist Science fair, participants will be challenged to apply principles and practices of justice to their own work[.] They will be challenged to ask themselves such questions as: Who benefits? Who is harmed? Who is most vulnerable? The workshop will supply participants with the practical skills and resources needed to push their research communities to be more inclusive, equitable and attentive to social justice.

"Title: Fighting Islamophobia Across the Western World  Article: A specter is haunting the Western world  the specter of Islamophobia. Just ask the folks at the Institute for Social Policy & Understanding (ISPU). What is the ISPU, you ask? Why, it's an organization that is, in its own words, dedicated to creating a vibrant and truly pluralistic America, where Muslims are strong and equal participants. To this end, the ISPU conducts objective, solution-seeking research that empowers American Muslims to develop their community and fully contribute to democracy and pluralism in the United States. Founded in 2002  note the date  it has become a trusted source for information for and about American Muslims. When I glanced through the names of its directors and advisors, the name that jumped out at me was that of the not-exactly-trustworthy John Esposito, perhaps America's most infamous apologist for Islam. In his 1999 book The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality? again, note the date  he assured readers that they had nothing to fear from the Religion of Peace. Since 9/11, he has continued to whitewash everybody's favorite faith in such books as What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam (2002) and The Future of Islam (2010). Just out from the ISPU is its American Muslim Poll 2018: From Pride to Prejudice, which seeks to gauge American's attitude toward Islam and Muslims in the era of Donald Trump, and which is a product of a collaboration with the Bridge Initiative, a multi-year research project that connects the academic study of Islamophobia with the public square and thus spread awareness of Islamophobia as an obstacle to strong pluralistic societies and therefore a threat to human dignity and civil liberties.",0
"Title: New Left Thinkers: Pursuing Utopia or Annihilation?  Article: How did we arrive at a world where the New York Times and other prominent mass media extol leaders of the brutal North Korean regime at the Olympics? The answer is that our current mainstream journalists and educational establishment are largely the ideological offspring of the European and American thinkers of the New Left. Thanks to Roger Scrutons book Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left, I can now better understand my own experiences of contemporary academia. Until fifteen years ago I devoted a lot of effort to promoting critical thinking in higher education in Japan and Asia. Then I came up against widespread resistance among academics to the inculcation of rationality and eventually gave up on many of those efforts, mystified by the current ascendency of relativistic thinking in the university world. Even more puzzling has been the emergence of Marxist thought among evangelical intellectuals like Tim Keller. A conservative British philosopher and prolific writer, Roger Scruton does a superb job of explaining how this state of affairs came about. He probes the writings of many influential European and American New Left thinkers, such as Sartre, Said, Foucault, Adorno, Derrida, Rorty, and Zizek. Rather than trying to cover his analysis of these writers in detail, this review will bring out some prominent themes of the whole book that impressed me, including some representative quotes. To begin with, the New Left thinkers clearly revealed their hostility to ordinary people and their traditions. Like the older Marxists before them, they demonized the bourgeoisie, which basically means middle-class people.",1
"Title: Egyptian government steps down - media  Article: Egyptian government steps down - media Egypt's governments has stepped down, online version of Al-Ahram newspaper reported on Monday. The publication added that the decision was taken after a 15-minute session of the Cabinet. Egypt's military-backed government has quit, state-run Al Ahram said on Monday in a report confirmed by an Egyptian official, a step likely to pave the way for army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to declare his candidacy for president. The newspaper, citing an unnamed source in a report on its website, said the decision was made after a 15-minute cabinet meeting. For Sisi to run for president, he would first need to leave his post of defence minister. ""This was done as a step that was needed ahead of Sisi's announcement that he will run for president,"" an Egyptian official said. Sisi unveiled a political roadmap meant to lead to elections after toppling Islamist President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood in July following mass protests against his rule. Morsi's removal triggered the bloodiest political crisis in Egypt's modern history, with security forces killing hundreds of his supporters and jailing thousands. Hundreds of security personnel have also died in the turmoil. Egyptian Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi said on Monday the government is to resign.

"Title: Iran and Hamas Test Limits of Israels Patience  Article: Three weeks ago, the BBC revealed that Iran was in the process of constructing a military base just south of Damascus near the town of Al-Kiswah, 31 miles from the Israeli border. The British broadcaster displayed what it described as satellite photos showing a series of symmetrical structures arranged in a deliberate pattern, and connected by a road. That base was hit over the weekend in the early morning hours of December 2. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that loud explosions were heard in the vicinity of Damascus and electricity was cut off in parts of the city. The Times of Israel, citing Arab media reports, noted that at least 12 Iranians were killed in the blasts and some of their names were posted on accounts of a messaging app associated with Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. As is its wont, Israel has not commented on the attack, preferring instead to keep its enemies guessing. Some reports have suggested that Israel employed Jericho surface-to-surface missiles while others maintained that the Israeli Air Force fired a number of missiles while over Lebanese airspace. Regardless of the manner of attack, it is clear that the Netanyahu-led government will not permit Iran to create a new front on Israels border. Israel has on numerous occasions attempted to convey this message through diplomatic channels utilizing the Russians as interlocutors. Notwithstanding these diplomatic efforts, the base was not dismantled thus compelling military action. For Israel, the creation of an entrenched Iranian forward operating base on its northeastern border is a red line that cannot be crossed.",0

Just this past weekend, Robinson attended a pro-gun rally on Saturday that opposed the Communist ideology of David Hogg and his handlers at the Florida state capitol in Tallahassee. His epic speech has the same goal as the young people who were aligned with Hogg, the saving of our young people's lives, but his solution was a biblical, lawful and constitutional solution. Robinson has not changed his message since April. Back then he told his city council, It seems like every time we have one of these shootings, nobody wants to put the blame where it goes, which is at the shooters feet.

"Title: US Attempts To Meddle  Article: Moscow has seen attempts to meddle in the Russian elections coming from the US, a senior Russian diplomat said. It comes as Google is suspected of possibly violating the law by selling political ads for unsanctioned rally. Andrey Nesterenko, a senior Russian diplomat, said the US certainly does attempt to meddle in the Russian electoral processes, Interfax reported. He was speaking after a briefing on the issue. Our collective opinion is that electoral sovereignty is a principle that all civilized nations should respect, the diplomat said, adding that Moscow will notify our American partners that the actions of their media outlets allow us to state that they are close to breaking Russian law. On Sunday, several Russian regions, including Moscow Region, will hold elections. Opposition leader Aleksey Navalny is calling for protests on that day to denounce the planned reform of the pension system, which is currently a hot political topic. Among other ways of spreading the word about the event, Navalnys public movement is using paid ads on Google services such as YouTube.

"Title: Kirov court finds Navalny guilty of embezzlement at Kirovles firm  Article: Kirov court finds Navalny guilty of embezzlement at Kirovles firm The Leninsky District Court in Kirov has found opposition figure Alexei Navalny guilty of embezzlement at the Kirovles company. Having considered materials of the case against Navalny and Pyotr Ofitserov, the court established that Navalny masterminded the embezzlement, judge Sergei Blinov said at the trial. Ofitserov was found guilty of assisting the embezzlement, the judge said. The Leninsky District Court of Kirov started to hear the criminal case on embezzlement from the Kirovles company on April 17. The prosecution claims that more than 10,000 cubic meters of timber was stolen from Kirovles between May and September 2009, inflicting damages of more than 16 million rubles on the Kirov region's administration. Navalny, who at that time served as an advisor to regional governor Nikita Belykh, is accused of organizing the alleged theft. Ofitserov, who headed Vyatka Timber Company, and Kirovles chief executive Vyacheslav Opalev were accused of complicity in the alleged embezzlement. Navalny is charged with ""organization of the embezzlement of an exceptionally large amount of property"". In December 2012 Opalev was given a suspended four-year sentence with a probation period of three years.",0
