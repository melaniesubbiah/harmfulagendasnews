"Title: Soros Buying San Diego DA Race  Article: Leftist billionaire George Soros is injecting big money into a San Diego district attorney race as part of his larger effort to install extremist prosecutors across America who will refuse to enforce inconvenient laws that liberals and progressives dont like. Soros, who turns 88 in August, has been underwriting district attorney races across America in an effort to dismantle the criminal justice system, empty the prisons, and sabotage the enforcement of immigration laws. Soros supports state and local efforts to resist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and wants to cripple police in order to advance the neo-Marxist abstraction known as social justice that simplistically breaks the world down into race, class, and sex or gender. Radicals claim that American laws and institutions are inherently corrupt and that these systems protect, for example, wealthy, white, native-born, non-disabled males at the expense of everyone else. Getting people who share Soross worldview into public office at every level is key to promoting his ugly vision of how America, which he calls the main obstacle to a stable and just world order, should look. Months ago Soros saturation-bombed his Open Society Foundations philanthropy with an $18 billion donation, likely guaranteeing OSF will remain one of the most important players in left-wing activism for decades to come. According to the New York Times, this was one of the largest transfers of wealth ever made by a private donor to a single foundation.

"Title: LGBT victory in Canada, government allows third gender option on passports  Article: NewsGender OTTAWA, August 29, 2017 (LifeSiteNews)  Canadas Liberal government has cleared the way for Canadians who dont want to identify as either male or female to opt for an X on their passport. Pro-family advocates decry the move as further entrenching the false ideology of gender fluidity. This is so harmful, says Jack Fonseca, senior political strategist with Campaign Life Coalition. The government trying to force its citizenry, en masse, to deny scientific fact and biological reality. Fonseca says the move is dangerous for children who are at risk of sexual confusion by the further societal normalization of transgenderism. Canadians are harmed by unwittingly but systematically being trained to deny the evidence of their own eyes, he told LifeSiteNews in an email. And it will hurt people suffering with the mental illness of gender dysphoria by corroborating the illusion they can alter their sex. Meanwhile, transgender activists complain this doesnt go far enough, and that the provinces are dragging behind their federal counterpart. X for not sure about sex Minister of Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada Ahmed Hussen announced the new passport option August 24 as part of the Liberal governments commitment to support LGBTQ2 rights and advance the Governments agenda on gender equality, diversity and inclusion, according to a ministry statement. The X option to indicate unspecified sex on a passport is available August 31.",1
"Title: Unnecessary Loss of Life  Article: War is nasty, brutal and costly. In our latest wars, many of the casualties suffered by American troops are a direct result of their having to obey rules of engagement created by politicians who have never set foot on  or even seen  a battlefield. Today's battlefield commanders must be alert to the media and do-gooders who are all too ready to demonize troops involved in a battle that produces noncombatant deaths, so-called collateral damage. According to a Western Journalism article by Leigh H Bravo, ""Insanity: The Rules of Engagement"" (http://tinyurl.com/p59nlqs), our troops fighting in Afghanistan cannot do night or surprise searches. Also, villagers must be warned prior to searches. Troops may not fire at the enemy unless fired upon. U.S. forces cannot engage the enemy if civilians are present. And only women can search women. Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney said: ""We handcuffed our troops in combat needlessly. This was very harmful to our men and has never been done in U.S combat operations that I know of."" Collateral damage and the unintentional killing of civilians are a consequence of war. But the question we should ask is: Are our troops' lives less important than the inevitable collateral damage? The unnecessary loss of life and casualties that result from politically correct rules of engagement are about to be magnified in future conflicts by mindless efforts to put women in combat units. In 2013, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta officially lifted the ban on women serving in ground combat roles. On Jan. 1, 2016, all branches of the military must either open all positions to women or request exceptions.",0
"Title: Secession from Obama's America  Article: Is it a Field of Dreams or a Plea for Return to a Constitutional Republic? Last night I stumbled upon an article, A Case For Secession-Introduction, (first of a series) on Gather.com and it struck me that the time may soon be approaching when one or two states will be called to step up for the rest of us in hopes of saving the Republic. Im not advocating for secession now; Im just looking at the possibility with a little more interest. How such a move might shift our government back to position where Representatives actually have to listen to and respect their constituents is a question that interests me. What is clear is that with Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid in control, Democratic Members of Congress are currently being effectively bribed with earmarks, promises or threats to pass legislation America does not want. They are not listening. Polling demonstrates over and over the majority of Americans are against government run healthcare, are against unreasonable infringement of our Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms, are against illegal immigration, are against socialism, are against tax dollar funding of organizations like ACORN and SEIU, are against politicians creating unsustainable debt that will cripple their childrens futures, are against government manipulate of the news, are against government creating more unsustainable entitlements, are against Congress not adhering to the Constitution, are against Congress exceeding their power, are against Congress trampling on the rights reserved to the states under the Constitution, and are against unreasonable infringement of rights of privacy and free speech. In many states, the majorities are huge.",0
"Title: Boston Children's Hospital kidnaps teen girl for 10 months, holds her as prisoner while threatening parents  Article: Boston Children's Hospital now engaged in felony criminal kidnapping Justina Pelletier is a prisoner of Boston Children's Hospital The ultimate medical tyranny Boston Children's Hospital has a history of medical abuse of children Why we are calling for the arrest and prosecution of hospital executives Action items: (NaturalNews) A 15-year-old Connecticut girl remains held by Boston Children's Hospital, a victim of the hospital's ""kidnap and ransom"" operation, traditionally called ""K&R."" K&R is not usually seen in hospitals, and that's what makes this story so bizarre and disturbing.Boston Children's Hospital kidnapped the teen girl from her Connecticut family nearly 10 months ago under the excuse of a contrived medical diagnosis. Through legal maneuvering, the hospital managed to gain legal custody of the girl, and the ""ransom demand"" is the demand that the parents stop trying to remove the girl from the hospital so that Boston Children's can generate maximum revenue from so-called ""treatments"" which have so far accomplished nothing. ""It is kidnapping,"" said the girl's father , Lou Pelletier. ""It's beyond any wildest nightmare that you could think of. ""The clinical psychologist known by the family says, ""It's the most bizarre situation ... I've ever been involved with.

"Title: Washington and Allies Go Orwellian  Article: Just as North and South Korea achieve important peaceful exchanges, Washington and its NATO allies appear to be moving with determination to sabotage the initiative for averting war on the East Asian peninsula. Further, the reckless, gratuitous provocations beg the conclusion that the United States is indeed trying to start a war. Meanwhile, unprecedented accusations this week by US President Donald Trump that Russia is supporting North Korea to evade United Nations sanctions also point to the danger that any conflict could spiral out of control to engulf world nuclear powers. Moscow rejected the unsubstantiated claims leveled by Trump, saying that Russia is abiding by UN trade restrictions over North Korea, and that the American presidents allegations were entirely unfounded. Trumps verbal broadside suggests that Washington is trying to undermine the nascent talks between the two Koreas, talks which Russia and China have both applauded as a long-overdue diplomatic effort to resolve the Korean conflict. Separately, Russias Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov deplored a summit held in Vancouver, Canada, earlier this week in which the US and 19 other nations  most of them NATO members  called for sharper sanctions on North Korea that go beyond the remit of the United Nations. The conference, co-hosted by Canadas Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, issued a stridently bellicose statement, calling in effect for North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons or face US-led military action. Significantly, and pointedly, China and Russia were not invited to the Canadian summit.",1
"Title: Politicians for a new world order Calling for Gun Control through Banning Bullets  InvestmentWatch  Article: by Thinker The concept of banning lead was floated before, but this latest effort to impose back door gun control has all the marking of a tin horn dictator stripping the peasants of any means of resistance. Drop the pretense. All you need to know is WHY IS GOVERNMENT STOCKPILING GUNS, AMMO?, while you are being told you are not allowed to have your own horde. How you answer this question, reveals much about your attitude towards government, and level of concern for protecting yourself from tyrannical edits. It is startling just how much of the population will accept de facto gun control for any trumped up scheme to impose further governmental mastery. SCOPE reports on the recent announcement on M855 ammunition. On 13 February 2015, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATF) released a document [PDF ] that proposed the reclassification of 5.56mm constituent projectiles of SS109 and M855 cartridges from the category of primarily used for sporting purposes to that of armor piercing ammunition. The 17-page document was titled: ATF FRAMEWORK FOR DETERMINING WHETHER CERTAIN PROJECTILES ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR SPORTING PURPOSES WITHIN THE MEANING OF 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(17) and uploaded to ATF.gov , in part to enable interested parties to review it and submit comments before 16 March 2015.

"Title: Egyptian government steps down - media  Article: Egyptian government steps down - media Egypt's governments has stepped down, online version of Al-Ahram newspaper reported on Monday. The publication added that the decision was taken after a 15-minute session of the Cabinet. Egypt's military-backed government has quit, state-run Al Ahram said on Monday in a report confirmed by an Egyptian official, a step likely to pave the way for army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to declare his candidacy for president. The newspaper, citing an unnamed source in a report on its website, said the decision was made after a 15-minute cabinet meeting. For Sisi to run for president, he would first need to leave his post of defence minister. ""This was done as a step that was needed ahead of Sisi's announcement that he will run for president,"" an Egyptian official said. Sisi unveiled a political roadmap meant to lead to elections after toppling Islamist President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood in July following mass protests against his rule. Morsi's removal triggered the bloodiest political crisis in Egypt's modern history, with security forces killing hundreds of his supporters and jailing thousands. Hundreds of security personnel have also died in the turmoil. Egyptian Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi said on Monday the government is to resign. ""Today the cabinet took a decision to offer its resignation to the president of the republic,"" Beblawi said in a televised statement.",0
"Title: Anti-American Leftists Set To Expose Themselves At President Trump's First State Of The Union Speech  Article: The NWO neo-Nazi Left in Washington just cannot help themselves in identifying who they really are. During president Trump's first State of the Union speech in 2018, they will be showing us who the real anti-Americans are by either not showing up in protest, or by wearing black. The usual known psychos like Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, Al Green, John McCain, Frederica Wilson, John Lewis, Jeff Flake, and the list goes on, will either not be attending the SOTU or be wearing black. As many as 40 lawmakers have said they will not be attending the event at all. The benefit to American Patriots who believe in the sovereignty of the United States and the constitution as the basis of all law in the country, will be knowing who the people in office are who are busy trying to destroy their country. The usual protests against president Trump have already been arranged by some of these lawmakers to take place outside during the speech, which tells us basically that most of these lawmakers who are protesting against the President are either very close or actual members of the known terrorist groups BLM and ANTIFA. The DNC passed a resolution in 2015 supporting BLM and Hillary Clinton has funneled millions to BLM via various transactions from the Clinton Foundation. Since both BLM and ANTIFA have been labeled as terrorist organizations by the FBI and DHS, anyone who donates money to either of them is committing an act of treason against the US and should be arrested. The group BLM was the brainchild of Barack H Obama, thus it comes as no surprise that the Clinton's and most of the anti-American Left support it and or actually belong to it.",1
"Title: Kim Jong-uns Peace Gambit  Article: It appears that the outreach to South Korea by North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, which began in the lead-up to and during the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, did not end with the Olympics closing ceremony. Kim Jong-un has just hosted talks with a high-level delegation from South Korea, led by its national security director Chung Eui-yong. The South Korean delegation came away believing that these talks have borne some fruit. A possible summit meeting between Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in was discussed, which could occur in late April at the so-called Peace House, which is located on the South Korean side of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone. In the meantime, the two Koreas have reportedly agreed to set up a telephone hotline between the leaders of both countries. The South Koreans also indicated that North Korea would agree to halt tests of its nuclear weapons and missiles in conjunction with opening talks with the United States on the denuclearization issue. According to Chung Eui-yong, the North Koreans are looking for a credible security guarantee and the end to military threats against it, in which case they believed they would not need to keep their nuclear arsenal. He claimed that North Korea was interested ""in an open-ended dialogue to discuss the issue of denuclearization and to normalize relations with North Korea."" Notably, Kim Jong-un is said to have withdrawn, at least for now, his insistence that the United States and South Korea suspend their joint military exercises as a precondition to any negotiations.",0
"Title: On Same Day Trump Releases Nunes' Memo, Federal Judge Keeps Comey Memos Secret  Article: On the same day the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released the Nunes memo showing the FBI relied on the salacious and unverified Trump dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant on Carter Page, a federal judge ruled to withhold the Comey memos. The memos, authored by former FBI Director James Comey, are about his nine private conversations with President-elect and President Trump. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who ruled in favor of the FBIs request to keep the Comey memos secret, also sits on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The FISA Court is the same court that approved the surveillance on Trump associates. Boasberg refused to release the documents on the basis they were still being used by special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation of the alleged Russian collusion with Trump associates. The judge ruled, the Comey Memos, at least for now, will remain in the hands of the Special Counsel and not the public. Its unfortunate, but not at all surprising, to see a FISA court judge side with secrecy over transparency on the very day the House Intelligence Committee released a very troubling example of abuse of trust within the FISA system, said Christopher Bedford, the editor-in-chief of TheDCNF. On March 16, one week after Trump fired Comey, the public first learned the former FBI director had penned a memo on a Feb. 14 Oval Office meetings with President Trump. Comey told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 8 testimony that he authored secret memos of all his meetings and conversations with President-elect and President Trump.",0
"Title: CNNs Chris Cillizza, Along With Peers In The Mainstream Media, Are Rapidly Losing Their Credibility  Article: CNNs Chris Cillizza, along with most of his peers in the mainstream media, are rapidly losing their credibility. They are ignoring the real story at their peril. CNNs Chris Cillizza is absolutely outraged that President Trump would not allow himself to fall into Adam Schiffs obvious trap. The rebuttal memo, intentionally filled with highly sensitive, classified material, was written to provide Adam Schiff with a new opportunity to attack Trump. Schiff and his fellow Democrats were well aware that the rebuttal memo would not be able to be declassified without major redactions to protect sensitive information. He knew that Trump would have to either heavily redact the memo, or not release it. Either scenario would provide Schiff with ammunition. Instead of his administration making the redactions and igniting a political firestorm, Trump chose a third option, the least bad option. He essentially told Schiff to make the necessary changes himself, remove the sources and methods that Schiff railed about prior to the release of the Nunes (which the Nunes memo did not contain, and yes, Schiff had read the document and was very well aware of this fact) and then we can release it. The White House included a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray that says they have identified portions of the Democratic memo that would raise national security or law enforcement concerns if released publicly.",1

Antonio Villaraigosa has a shot at becoming California's first Latino governor since 1875. But he doesn't want to hear that. I'm an American, not only a Latino, Villaraigosa said in a recent interview with Newsweek. I love this country. With the election still a year away, Villaraigosa, who appeared on the cover of Newsweek after becoming Los Angeles' first Latino mayor in 2005, already faces a long road to Sacramento. His chief opponent, former mayor of San Francisco and current Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, a so-called golden boy of California politics, is out-polling and out-fundraising him. ....Last month, his campaign released a 12-minute video created by Mark Putnam, the director behind one of Barack Obama's famous 30-minute campaign video during the 2008 presidential election.

"Title: Obama Created Over 1 Million Jobs... By Founding New Industry Of Professional Protesting  Article: As protesters waited at locations across the country for President Trump to announce his nomination for Supreme Court Justice, many on social media were saying these people needed to simply, get a job. It is surprising to see that a good number of people believe these protesters are average citizens either taking time off work or are unemployed and just have the time to go out and protest. Those of us, who have followed politics for many years, however, know that to today's US protesters, this is their job. Unlike past street demonstrators of the 1960s and 1970s, whod gathered to protest the Vietnam War and the US government based solely on their strong beliefs, today's public displays of violence and civil unrest are totally carried out by well-organized businesses that have thousands of members and hire people as professional protesters. Thus, we have a massive employment sector of individuals who wake up every morning and prepare to go to work in their profession as protesters, just like the rest of us who do the same at our legitimate jobs. The hours can be a bit rough for the employees of the protest industry as you are required to work at various hours of a 24 hour period, sometimes having to attend multi protests per day, or participating in sit-ins that may last a week or more. take our poll - story continues below  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

His company led the investigation into the hacking attack in April and June.As further reported byThe latest attack was certainly not the first time that China-based hackers have stolen information from American companies, but it is the largest cyber attack of its kind involving patient information since a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website began tracking such breaches in 2009.",1
"Title: Italy Is Not Headed For Authoritarianism  Article: Michael Ledeen is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center and Freedom Scholar at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Barbara and I are finishing up three weeks in Italy, and it's not a happy place. But, for a long time, it hasn't been nearly as happy as most Americans believed. It's a deceptive place, where suffering is usually hidden by tough language, considerable charm, and extraordinary music. Italians are very dramatic, and those who spend time there (Ive been at it for more than fifty years) often wonder if they are on stage or in the audience. Don't forget that, just beneath the apparently cheerful exterior, there has long lurked one of the oldest traditions of political assassination in the world, from Caesar to the mafia. Its always been a tough place, remember that Italy invented fascism. And Hitlers hero and inspiration was Mussolini. There are those who think that there is a fascist revival under way, but I dont see it. I see chaos, populism, and all manner of social and economic programs, the outcome of which is unknowable. As usual, Italy is testing the political waters, as it always has. Its Europes political laboratory. There's a new government, composed of big-talking leaders whose programs call for guaranteed minimum incomes,flat taxes, and much tougher border controls along the country's ocean borders. The latter is highly contentious, and has produced a series of nasty meetings with EU leaders, notably the French. The Italians want other governments, from elsewhere in Europe to North Africa, to shoulder a greater share of the burden.",0
"Title: Senator Flake's Sad, Pathetic and Ignorant Speech  Article: Senator Flake, a politician who works hard at pretending to believe something, gave a speech attacking the President of the United States for criticizing the media. This Doonesbury character come to life 'courageously' delivered a speech defending major media conglomerates and their right to override elections. Because he loves freedom and truth. The speech perfectly captured Flake's insipid cluelessness. It reads like it was written by a college sophomore who is very passionate about ideas, but doesn't actually understand them. Take his opening. ""Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident ..."" So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America."" It's an applause line, but no one's applauding except the leftist media that hates the founders and Jefferson. It's also a line that could have only been produced by googling, ""founders"" and ""truth"". Jefferson wasn't writing about truth, as Flake invokes it, but about the principles on which this nation is based. And he's saying that being self-evident, they don't require further philosophical proofs. It has nothing to do with ""shared facts between the governed and the government."" That's a creepy prog idea with a whiff of 1984.",1

"Title: Taking the Left Seriously--Is Corey Robin Right? | Blog Posts  Article: Marxian graphomaniac Corey Robin [Emai him] is a lot of things, but dumb is not one of them. His recent piece for NBC News is a reminder of this. Titled The future of the GOP currently is a long, painful decline. Paul Ryan saw the writing on the wall  who's next?, the piece is not so different from James Kirkpatricks Ryanism Is Dead, But Has It Killed Trumpism? Robin noticed that:  Instead of the major assault on entitlements and welfare that Ryan had promised, he and his fellow Republicans have pushed through a domestic budget to make Barack Obama proud, as Russell Berman wrote in the Atlantic. The GOPs $1.3 trillion budget increases funding for Pell Grants, Head Start, the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Department of Education, Health and Human Services and renewable energies. It includes no cuts to the EPA, Planned Parenthood, or sanctuary cities. Whereas Kirkpatrick put it like this:  Even by his own wonkish standard of limiting government spending and preventing the fiscal crisis of soaring entitlement costs, Paul Ryan is a failure. [Paul Ryans Missed Opportunities on Spending, by Dan McLaughlin, National Review, April 11, 2018] Indeed, Ryan somehow managed the impressive task of funding the Lefts priorities while not funding those of his president in the latest Omnibus spending bill. Robin observes:  Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were reelected in landslide popular victories. George W. Bush and Donald Trump crept into power with the help of the Supreme Court and the Electoral College, counter-majoritarian institutions designed by the Framers to frustrate the popular will.",1
"Title: Why is the Left so Defensive of Obamas Religion?  Article: For once, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is in trouble for something he didnt say as opposed to something he did. Specifically, hes taking heat for his failure to defend Barack Obama when one of his supporters questioned his Christian faith. We have a problem in this country, said a man attending Trumps rally in New Hampshire Thursday night. Its called Muslims. We know our current president is one. You know hes not even an American  birth certificate, man  We have training camps growing, where they want to kill us. Thats my question. When can we get rid of them? Trump looked around.

You know, a lot of people are saying that, and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there. Were going to look at that and plenty of other things. Not much meat on the bones of that answer, but that didnt stop a legion of liberal critics from slamming the GOP frontrunner. Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz issued a statement reading: Donald Trumps racism knows no bounds. This is certainly horrendous but unfortunately unsurprising given what we have seen already. The vile rhetoric coming from the GOP candidates is appalling. Others piled on, demanding to know why Trump didnt insist that Obama was both an American and a Christian. Likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was inspired to personally use her Twitter account to say, Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing, & just plain wrong.",1

"Title: The Young and the Stupid  Article: Oh, the virtue-signaling was hot and heavy as conservative and ostensibly libertarian media outlets competed to see who come up with the most self-righteously abusive rhetoric to describe North Korean Politburo member Kim Yo Yong, sister to Kim Jong Un. BuzzFeed grabbed the prize with a garbage monster  BuzzFeed being an expert when it comes to garbage. Reasons Nick Gillespie could hardly contain his joy at the fusillade of hatred: It was younger media outlets and personalities such as Buzzfeed and CNNs Jake Tapper that called bullshit on such stories. In Gillespies world, young is a synonym for good, because the young and the stupid will inherit the earth. Tapper is one of the War Partys most fulsome cheerleaders, and BuzzFeeds working relationship with the US State Department during the Obama administration was pretty brazen: but if Gillespie means young and dumb, or young and bought off, then perhaps hes right. If you hate US leaders more than you hate the Kim Jong-un regime, tweeted Tapper the tool, you really need to read up on North Korea and he helpfully supplied a link to Human Rights Watchs analysis of North Korea. Hatred of foreign bogeymen is what Tapper, Gillespie, and all those no-longer-quite-so-young media mavens deal in: were supposed to hate Kim Yo Yong, those North Korean cheerleaders, and anyone who isnt in a tizzy about North Korean propaganda supposedly broadcast by the media.

"Title: PLO Terrorists Won't Let Us Mediate, Will Take Our $$$  Article: Bad news. The Islamic terrorist group we fund won't let us mediate the non-existent peace process that they've rejected and walked away from every time and under every previous president. I don't know what we'll do now. But it'll probably involve giving them more money (thanks to everyone who neutered the Taylor Force Act) and trying to negotiate an impossible peace with them anyway. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told an international summit Wednesday that the United States was unfit to mediate the Mideast conflict, marking a major policy shift after decades spent courting American goodwill. But there is a role for the US in giving Abbas hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Sometimes the PLO reminds me of a murderous brat. ""I'm not gonna talk to you dad, but you still have to pay for everything."" I have a modest proposal. It involves not funding terrorists. Especially snotty terrorists. Abbas said Trumps decision was a crime, which came at a time when the Palestinians were engaged with Washington in a new push to reach a long-elusive peace agreement with Israel, the deal of our times. Instead we got the slap of our times, Abbas said. The United States has chosen to lose its qualification as a mediator ... We will no longer accept that it has a role in the political process. He suggested the U.N. should take over as mediator. That sounds like a plan. The UN and the PLO should mediate negotiations over which of them hates Jews more.
