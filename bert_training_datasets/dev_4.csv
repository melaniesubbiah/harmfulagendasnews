"Title: New York State Now Under Dem Domination Due To Changing Demographics, GOP Cucking  Article: New York is a perfect example of the political transformation caused by a browning electorate. Long Island, which might be the part of the state that has been most impacted by the Democrats' demographic replacement policies was what enabled state Democrats to take over complete political control of the state government this past Tuesday. Republicans not only lost, but they were blasted out of the Senate control in a turf they had long called home: Long Island. Changing demographics had weakened their once iron grip on Senate districts. Only a couple years ago, they still managed to occupy all nine Long Island Senate seats. They called themselves the Long Island Nine. After Tuesdays results, they are the Long Island Three,"" as Democrats picked up five seats in Nassau and one in Suffolk county. [Upstate loses sole Albany power base after Democratic Senate takeover, By Tom Precious, The Buffalo News, November 8, 2018]  The news might only casually mention the ""changing demographic"" aspect of the elections but the reality is that it was the key to the Democrats gaining power. The Democrats have been blatant in their efforts to weaponize the Hispanic vote in Long Island.",0
"Title: WHO Prepares For Worst Case As Congo Ebola Outbreak Spreads  Article: This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge  In the week since we first noted the new outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the number of cases has risen by 50%, and The World Health Organization has now said it is preparing for the worst case scenario. The WHO has tallied 32 suspected or confirmed cases in the northwestern area of Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumbathe near the border with the Republic of Congo, including 18 deaths, between April 4 and May 9. The outbreak, declared by the DRC health ministry on Tuesday, is the DRCs ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976,when the deadly viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team. Scientists are greatly concerned that this outbreak in the remote Bikoro region will travel 175 miles to the city of Mbandaka  the capital of Equateur province and home to around 1.2 million residents. Weve updated this map. Turns out that the provincial capital of Equateur, Mbandaka, is home to roughly 1M people. Its less than 300 km or 175 miles from Bikoro and reachable by water. pic.twitter.com/3Q3PwAAdsh  Helen Branswell (@HelenBranswell) May 11, 2018  Whats worrisome is that the most recent WHO update says that there are two probable cases at Wangata  which is very close to Mbandaka. #EbolaDRC: This news gives me pause. @WHOs latest update says there are 2 probable cases at Wangata, which is adjacent to the provincial capital, Mbandaka. Population of Mbandaka = 1.2 million.",0
"Title: Why One Doctor Believes A Killer Flu Pandemic Is Just Around The Corner  Article: Dr. Jonathan Quick, a medical doctor and one of the worlds top health professionals claims that the conditions are perfect for a new superbug in the form of a killer flu virus pandemic. Quick also believes that this pandemic could kill upwards of 33 million people in just 200 days. A piece written by Dr. Quick and published on The Daily Mail UKs website lays out why the doctor believes this pandemic is just around the corner. The big one is coming: a global virus pandemic that could kill 33 million victims in its first 200 days. Within the ensuing two years, more than 300 million people could perish worldwide. Dr. Jonathan Quick, The Daily Mail UK  Quick says one extreme scenario of a killer flu pandemic will fling the globe into financial chaos. If millions of people die because of the pandemic, there wont be enough survivors to run the computers or energy systems, leaving many to loot or die of starvation in the months following such a deadly outbreak. As a medical doctor and a health chief who has led global programmes at the World Health Organisation (WHO), I believe that the world is at risk of a viral pandemic that will be at least as deadly as anything we have ever known before. The most likely culprit will be a new and unprecedentedly deadly mutation of the influenza virus. The conditions are right. It could happen tomorrow. Dr. Jonathan Quick, The Daily Mail UK  A century after the Spanish Influenza outbreak which killed 100 million people, we are just as vulnerable to the flu now, says Dr. Qucik. But what about all those fancy vaccines? Doesnt that mean they dont work? Logic says yes but propaganda says no.",0
"Title: PLO Terrorists Won't Let Us Mediate, Will Take Our $$$  Article: Bad news. The Islamic terrorist group we fund won't let us mediate the non-existent peace process that they've rejected and walked away from every time and under every previous president. I don't know what we'll do now. But it'll probably involve giving them more money (thanks to everyone who neutered the Taylor Force Act) and trying to negotiate an impossible peace with them anyway. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told an international summit Wednesday that the United States was unfit to mediate the Mideast conflict, marking a major policy shift after decades spent courting American goodwill. But there is a role for the US in giving Abbas hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Sometimes the PLO reminds me of a murderous brat. ""I'm not gonna talk to you dad, but you still have to pay for everything."" I have a modest proposal. It involves not funding terrorists. Especially snotty terrorists. Abbas said Trumps decision was a crime, which came at a time when the Palestinians were engaged with Washington in a new push to reach a long-elusive peace agreement with Israel, the deal of our times. Instead we got the slap of our times, Abbas said. The United States has chosen to lose its qualification as a mediator ... We will no longer accept that it has a role in the political process. He suggested the U.N. should take over as mediator. That sounds like a plan. The UN and the PLO should mediate negotiations over which of them hates Jews more. The summit of the 57-member Organization of Muslim Cooperation concluded with the so-called Istanbul Declaration, outlining the blocs response to Trumps declaration.",0
"Title: North Korea Executes Prominent General For Racist Comments  Article: By Ray Charlston A shocking racist incident took place in Pyongyang, North Korea, Tuesday of last week. Basketball player Dennis Rodman returned to the DPRK, at the special invitation of General Kim Jong-un, who himself is an avid and long time basketball fan. Rodman had been invited to attend a state parade in honor of North Korean basketball players. This extravagant eight-hour long parade, featured what is believed to be the largest inflatable basketball ever created. According to some South-Korean analysts, attendance at the parade, as well as flag waving, was reported to be compulsory for all Pyongyang residents. Jung Go-Wong, a prominent middle-aged general in the Korean Peoples Army, was to introduce Rodman who was invited to say a few words before the beginning of the event. Not realizing that his microphone was turned on already, the general turned to his wife and stated that Korean people are uniquely virtuous, owing to the purity of our blood since ancient times. Rodman is nothing but a dumb ugly ape! I dont know why Kim Jong-un would invite this beast to visit again. I am so tired of him and his stupid monkey antics, he belongs in a zoo! Last time Rodman was this drunk he was defecating in the hotel hallway! The aghast audience, including the Korean public as well as top North Korean officials reportedly looked on in horror as they were subjected to outrageous racist hate speech. Technicians struggled to find a way to cut the microphone, as the ghastly and obscene verbal offense continued. General Jung Go-Wong went on to say to his wife Did you see the way he looked at our daughter?",1
"Title: Palin for Queen  Article: Palin just finished with the debate tonight, and let me just say, Im a convert, she really sold me tonight. I think shes ready to be queen. And queens dont need no stinkin debate rules. You want to ask her this, shell answer with that  what America really needs to know  about her, about McCain, and about the Republican commitment to families all across this great land, and we just need to reform the economy and get it back on track, and shell do that, because she reformed Alaska, and Alaska has lots of resources there, you know, and it supplies energy for America, and its close to Russia, so she knows about foreign policy there too. Shes a mavericks maverick, and when shes queen, she wont be just part of the executive, because theres flexibility there, and her administration would work with Congress and shell make the most of that flexibility, you know, that was written in the constitution there. And gosh darn it, like the current maverick vice-president Cheney, she would be part of the legislative branch as well, and being the ever-confident reformer, she would likely find a way to be part of the judicial branch too, because America needs that kind of leadership. Heck, maybe she could sit in on the Supreme Court on important issues like abortion and freedom of the press, and what goes into our libraries. The far left says she didnt even pay attention to the questions. But Palin didnt need to  she answers to America. Because thats what the Straight Talk Express is all about. What with everything she said about this and about that, and freedom, tolerance, family and freedom and all those things, and that folksy charm, I just cant tell you.",0
"Title: BLM Whistleblower Believes BLM Was In Violation Of Law Regarding Its Law Enforcement Authority at Bundy Ranch  Article: BLM Whistleblower Believes BLM Was In Violation Of Law Regarding Its Law Enforcement Authority at Bundy Ranch  Please help support us with cryptocurrency donations. Thank you! Washington State Representative Matt Shea spoke about the sealed hearings going on in Nevada concerning the Bundy Ranch trials last week, including a kill list, and hes back with an update in which a Bureau of Land Management agent is attempting to provide propaganda in an attempt to discredit former FLM agent Larry Wooten, who blew the whistle on the corruption, unprofessionalism and quite possibly, criminal activities of agents within the BLM. However, in revealing that information, it was also revealed that Agent Wooten believed the BLM was in violation of the law regarding its law enforcement authority. In the latest documents, BLM Agent Kent Klemen, who is a government witness in this case, makes an attempt to discredit Mr. Wootens claims. Keep that in mind, as Klemens first words are that the BLM was requested to remove Mr. Wooten from the Bundy Ranch investigation at the request of prosecutor Steven Myhre. And why did Myhre want Wooten removed? According to Klemen, Wooten had made recent statements that Wooten believes the BLM lacks law enforcement authority. Looks like someone was waking up in the Matrix . The request by Myhre came on February 17 of this year, and it was implemented on the 18th, just one day later, according to Klemen. Take a look as Rep. Shea explains what is extremely important information in the Bundy Ranch case.",0
"Title: The Trump Collusion Conspiracy Theory Falls Apart  Article: Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. Robert Mueller was appointed to investigate Russian collusion back in May. A new year is upon us. The warm May temperatures have been replaced by a deep freeze and snow is falling in Tallahassee. But after blowing through around $7 million and putting on an exciting show of surprise raids, gag orders, leaks and the varying pleas and indictments; Mueller still hasnt produced a single collusion indictment. Its much easier to pick Manaforts lock than to prove Hillary Clintons conspiracy theory. What Mueller did was harass a bunch of already shady characters into pleading guilty on minor charges, some, like lying to the FBI, created by his own investigation. All he had to do was get his team of Obama and Clinton supporters in front of Obama and Clinton judges who would rubber stamp anything. And the grand jury allegedly looked like a Bernie Sanders or Black Lives Matter rally with some participants wearing left-wing shirts. There wasnt a single white male among the 20 jurors. Thats a convenient way to screen out likely Trump supporters and bring in likely Trump opponents. Blatantly rigging it to a low bar is an admission by Mueller and his team that their case is too weak for prime time. Even now Manafort is suing the DOJ. His lawsuit may go nowhere, but the odds are good that Muellers tactics and evidence wont stand up to serious scrutiny. Thats what happened with key Mueller team member Andrew Weissmanns assault on Arthur Andersen.",1
"Title: The End of the Church of Slogans?  Article: But Franciss handpicked coordinator of the Council, Cardinal Oscar ( Mad Dog ) Rodrguez Maradiaga of Honduras, has just been exposed as a financial huckster thriving on the backs of the poor about which he pontificates constantly in the usual manner of a Latin American leftist ideologue. Is anyone surprised? Before discussing the details of the scandal and its significance for the Church at large, a few words about the Cardinals background are in order. Like every other propaganda theme concocted by the Vatican apparatus since Vatican II, including the conciliar springtime, dialogue with the world, the liturgical renewal, the ecumenical venture and the New Evangelization, the theme of Francis the Great Reformer is a hoax that conceals an underlying, ever-worsening state of ecclesial dissolution whose scope is without precedent in Church history. Francis the Great Reformer was supposed to accomplish the mighty work of converting a self-referential Church into the Church of the Pooranother hoaxwith the aid of a Council of Cardinalsyet another hoaxthat would help him reform the Roman Curia and decentralize Roman authority in favor of the peripheriesstill another hoax.

"Title: Trump's Pick for CIA Chief Backs Jailing Snowden, May Lead to Death Penalty  Article: US President Barack Obama has stated that he cant pardon NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, a claim that is not entirely true. The incoming administration takes an even tougher stance: execute him. Earlier this week, Obama said in an online interview with the German media outlet Der Spiegel that he ""can't pardon somebody who hasn't gone before a court and presented themselves. ""  AFP 2018/ Glen CHAPMAN Obama: Pardon for Snowden Couldnt Be Contemplated Until US Court Appearance However, there are apparently no legislative restrictions on a presidential pardon. According to a Supreme Court ruling from 1886, ""The power of pardon conferred by the Constitution upon the President is unlimited except in cases of impeachment. It extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment. The power is not subject to legislative control. "" As P.S. Ruckman, editor of the Pardon Power blog, put it, ""I just think what he may have better said is: I prefer that he present himself to a court and then we'll talk turkey.' But technically in terms of the Constitution, there are no restrictions at all. "" Mike Pompeo, President-Elect Donald Trump's pick for CIA director takes a draconian position on the issue.",0
"Title: St. Cloud, MN: Site of Jihad Attack by Muslim Migrant Rejects Resolution Calling for Moratorium on Immigration  Article: Muslim migrant Dahir Adan went on a stabbing spree at a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota in September 2016. Dressed in a private security uniform, Adan yelled Islam, Islam and Allahu akbar, as well as asking several people whether they were Muslim before stabbing them during the Sept. 17 attack. This was signature jihad  we have seen jihadis separate Muslim from non-Muslims during the attacks at the Oberoi Trident hotel, the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower in Mumbai, at the Westgate in Nairobi, the beach resort in Tunisia, the gas complex attack in Algeria, etc. A little over a year later, the City Council of the same city, St. Cloud, Minnesota, rejected a moratorium on immigration. They already suffered a jihad attack by a Muslim migrant, but it did not teach them anything. They still either dont know or dont care that it is impossible to distinguish jihadi Muslims from peaceful Muslim refugees. They either dont know or dont care that any Muslim who reads and believes the Qurans verses about making war against and killing unbelievers could go jihad at any time. To be concerned about such things is islamophobic. St. Clouds City Council either doesnt know or doesnt care that the kind of jihad attack that Dahir Adan perpetrated in their city last year could happen again. And so it will. St. Cloud rejects resolution calling for moratorium on immigration, by Kelly Smith, Star Tribune, November 7, 2017:  ST.

"Title: House Intel Committee Officially Starts Process To #ReleaseTheMemo  Article: On Saturday, Representative Dave Joyce (R-OH) announced that the House Intel Committee has been the official process to release the classified FISA memo that allegedly is so incriminating against the Obama administration, that Fox News contributor Sara Carter claimed it could bring the investigation by Robert Mueller to an end, while other congressmen said it could land people in the DOJ and FBI in jail. Joyce made the announcement on Twitter. Great news! Our efforts to #ReleaseTheMemo have been effective and the HPSIC plans to begin the process to release the FBI/FISA/Russia memo.

Dave Joyce (@RepDaveJoyce) January 20, 2018  OK, so, in less than 3 weeks, the memo should be made public to the people. Frankly, I have no idea why it would take three weeks to release this document. Are they going to redact it so much that the American people would know what all the fuss is about or is it really just a part of how slowly bureaucracy works in DC? All of this began on Friday when #ReleaseTheMemo hit Twitter. While Rolling Stone magazine claims that Russian bots (ie. Boris and Natasha of Bullwinkle fame ) were responsible for the popularity of the hashtag, the reality was that people simply want to see the evidence for themselves. The American public does not trust anyone in DC and they want the document made public so they can decide for themselves.",1
"Title: THE EXPERIENCE MEME  Article: The argument Republicans have been making that Obama has insufficient experience seems to me, on a little reflection, able to be shown as an essentially typical Republican (AND VERY ELITIST, AS REPUBLICANS REALLY ARE BY NATURE) position, reflecting the notion that ONLY those annointed by providence (by being in a favored position, usually by birth or wealth - or by being the handmaidens of those people) are fit to lead; and Obama clearly doesnt fit into that category, despite all his sterling qualities (which recitation is part of the Republican argument structure because the truth of those qualities is so obvious, and therefore must be countered somehow by means of this argument) essentially because he has not been around long enough to become part of the elite club of people who ARE qualified to lead (which could only happen, really, by his being accepted by those people - whatever such acceptance might cost).",0
"Title: Nintendos War on Women, Minorities and Democracy  Article: Special Investigative Report with Ray Charlston If you are like many people 30 and under you may have grown up on video games. Perhaps your family had a Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo, Gameboy, or a Nintendo 64. Perhaps you or your children own a Nintendo Wii. You may think video games are a harmless hobby or an enjoyable form of recreation, but think again! Video games can promote racism, sexism and anti-democratic attitudes! Nintendo Co. Ltd, headquartered in Kyoto Japan was literally founded on sexism, racism and Japanese Imperialism. Founded in 1889, its hateful legacy continues on to the present. Video games have spread around the world, poisoning the globe with hate. For this special report I will be interviewing Dr. Norman Frederickson of the Campaign for Justice, Equality and Peace. His organization is dedicated to fighting hatred and exposing bigotry and intolerance. RC: Dr. Frederickson, thank you for agreeing to accept this interview. NF: Of course. I was happy to accept your invitation this is a very important issue. One that I might add, I am deeply concerned about. RC: I understand that you have done extensive research into video games, Nintendo games specifically and what youve found has been, more than a little troubling? NF: Yes, indeed. Our children are being taught racism, sexism, colonialism, and even feudalism in these so-called Nintendo video games. What most people dont realize is that the Nintendo company has been around for some time, well before video games were invented. They used to make playing cards and other things.

"Title: San Francisco afraid to enforce buffer zone ordinance; Planned Parenthood ticked  Article: The PulseAbortion, Freedom In the aftermath of the Supreme Courts June 26 decision striking down Massachusetts 35-foot buffer zone law, the City of San Francisco has become squishy about enforcing its buffer zone ordinance, ticking off Planned Parenthood in the process. San Franciscos ordinance, which bans abortion opponents from entering a 25-foot line of demarcation around abortion clinics, is virtually identical to Massachusetts now voided law, minus 10 feet. Now, San Francisco pro-life activists are allegedly feeling their oats and defying the ordinance by crossing the line. Meanwhile, city attorneys are rightfully worried that enforcing the ordinance will draw pro-life ire and a lawsuit. So theyve chosen instead to withstand pro-abortion ire by ignoring the pro-life provocateurs, which has resulted in a letter of complaint from Planned Parenthood. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, July 27: Planned Parenthood executives say San Francisco police and the city attorney arent doing enough to protect patients and staff from harassment and intimidation at the organizations health center on Valencia Street [pictured above]. Each week, as the harassment and intimidation escalate the citys ordinances are violated ever more flagrantly, Planned Parenthoods Bay Area chapter leader, Heather Saunders Estes,wrote in a July 22 letter to City Attorney Dennis Herrera. And when center staffers call police, they are told that there is nothing they can do, Saunders Estes wrote. The protesters now ignore San Franciscos 25-foot buffer zone as they pass out literature, and film staffers and patients entering the building, clinic reps complain.",0
"Title: Where have all the men gone?  Article: OpinionFaith September 16, 2016 (BreakPoint) -- Are we in the midst of a masculinity crisis? Two Christian writers offered very different answers to this question in recent articles. David French at National Review laments a new statistic that shows todays young men are, physically, the weakest generation in recorded history. If youre the average Millennial male, he writes, your dad is stronger than you are. In fact, you may not be stronger than the average Millennial femaleThe very idea of manual labor is alien to you, and even if you were asked to help, say, build a back porch, the task would exhaust you to the point of uselessness. Welcome to the new, post-masculine reality. Chandler Epp replied to French in a guest column at Religion News Service, arguing that the idea of masculinity being equivalent to physical strength is misguided. Popular Christian notions of manhood, he writes, shame, repel, and ruin too many young boys and men who fail to meet those standards and who dont gravitate toward typical masculine behaviors. He concludes, We must recover the idea that the marker of a true man is his moral strength, not his muscular fitness. Now I know personally both Chandler and French, and I have a lot of respect for them both. In fact, they both demonstrate that sort of moral strength Chandler talks about in his piece. Chandler is right that when most folks ask, Where are all the men? what they mean is something like, where are all the lumberjacks?",0
"Title: Boston Children's Hospital kidnaps teen girl for 10 months, holds her as prisoner while threatening parents  Article: Boston Children's Hospital now engaged in felony criminal kidnapping Justina Pelletier is a prisoner of Boston Children's Hospital The ultimate medical tyranny Boston Children's Hospital has a history of medical abuse of children Why we are calling for the arrest and prosecution of hospital executives Action items: (NaturalNews) A 15-year-old Connecticut girl remains held by Boston Children's Hospital, a victim of the hospital's ""kidnap and ransom"" operation, traditionally called ""K&R.""

Through legal maneuvering, the hospital managed to gain legal custody of the girl, and the ""ransom demand"" is the demand that the parents stop trying to remove the girl from the hospital so that Boston Children's can generate maximum revenue from so-called ""treatments"" which have so far accomplished nothing.

"Title: NY Times op-ed calls pro-life websites fake news, demands Facebook silence them  Article: NewsAbortion NEW YORK, November 14, 2017 (LifeSiteNews)  Facebook must start cracking down on anti-abortion fake news, according to an opinion piece in Fridays online edition of the The New York Times. British journalist Rossalyn Warren raised a rallying cry to abortion advocates to lobby Facebook to black out sites like LifeNews and Live Action, which she accused of producing vast amounts of misinformation  such as the correlation between abortion and breast cancer. Indeed, articles from these sites are more shared on Facebook than evidence-based, credible articles about abortion from reputable news outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post, she complained. According to Warren, whose work has appeared in the Guardian and Buzzfeed, the problem is that Facebooks criteria to assess whats fake news doesnt generally apply to pro-life sites.

"Title: Pregnant on pointe shoes: how one professional dancer risked her career to choose life  Article: NewsCulture of Life Join a Facebook page dedicated to ending abortion here. DUPAGE, Illinois, September 15, 2011 (LifeSiteNews.com) - Rebecca was twenty-three years old, single, and enjoying a successful career as a professional dancer when she found out to her dismay that she was pregnant. The news couldnt have come at a more inopportune time. It was February of 2009, and Rebecca had just signed a contract with the Washington National Opera to dance for them from April to June of that year. I had to decide whether I was going to continue with the contract, or if I was going to step out because I was pregnant, the dancer, who wished to be referred to only by her first name, told LifeSiteNews in an interview. That was a really challenging decision to make, because I wasnt sure how much my body would show in the beginning. I was scared, nervous, and upset, she confided. Rebecca, who had been brought up in a pro-life, Christian home, now felt that she was faced with the agonizing choice of either ending her pregnancy or potentially ending her career. While married dancers do sometimes perform after having children, often by maintaining connections with the industry through their dancing husbands, Rebecca says the situation is not the same for single mothers.",0

"Title: HALF of Americans Die Broke! Pension Funds are GONE!  Article: HALF of Americans Die Broke! Pension Funds are GONE! Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! Its not just the government which has found itself in unpayable amounts of debt. The people of the U.S. have been following suit. Looking around the world we see that most people encountering the same mess. Even cultures who typically dont use debt and mortgages, have expanded into these ways in recent years. Theres no turning back. Why are pensions disappearing? Wiatrowski points to risk. Private companies want to take on less risk when helping to provide for their employees retirement. Its why these companies are ever more frequently turning to defined contribution plans  such as 401(k) plans  in which employees typically fund most of their own retirement by automatically setting aside money from each paycheck. This differs from traditional defined benefit pension plans, in which employers promise to provide their workers a specific monthly payout once they retire. In a defined benefit pension plan, the risk of retirement funding falls on employers, Wiatrowski says. Employers must provide the benefits theyve promised employees no matter if the company is struggling or if its made poor investments. This isnt the case with defined contribution plans. In defined contribution plans, the risk falls to the employees, Wiatrowski says. The employer might match some or all of their employees savings, but they still know that each month or once a year theyll have to put in X amount of dollars. Their commitment is a fixed amount.",0

"Title: A woman can go to Heaven, as long as shes accompanied by a male relative claims Saudi Imam  Article: The conservative Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is slowly but surely opening to an increased role for women in society, as for the first time in the countrys history, an important religious leader has declared it possible for women to be admitted into Heaven. In a sermon he delivered at the Prophets Mosque in Medina last Friday, the progressive Imam Sheikh Salah Al-Budair declared that women can be admitted into heaven, as long as they are accompanied by Mahram relatives (male kin, who is not suitable for marriage under Islamic law). I know that I will shock many people by saying this, but I think that women can indeed be admitted into Heaven. , the Imam preached. The Prophet said No woman should travel except with a Mahram. Ascending to heaven is the greatest trip in every good muslims existence. I dont believe that the Prophet meant this trip to be an exception. I think that a woman can get into Heaven, as long as shes accompanied by a man of her family. This, of course, implies that at least one man in her family needs to be admitted himself This surprising declaration is in complete rupture with the countrys traditional hard line, which states that woman can never be admitted into Heaven, under any circumstances. A group of conservative scholars and religious leaders from across Saudi Arabia, overseen by the countrys ministry of Islamic Affairs, signed a declaration condemning the Imams sermon as a blasphemy, and reaffirming that only men are worthy of going to Heaven. Its our responsibility to spread the true word of God, and all irresponsible people like Sheikh al-Budair are tarnishing Islam are contrary to the teachings of the Quran and the Hadith.",0
