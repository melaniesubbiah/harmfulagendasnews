"Title: Erdogan's Threat to Jerusalem  Article: In an unprecedented move, President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday, December 6, 2017, that the U.S. recognizes Jerusalem as Israels official capital. In an almost 20-minute speech, President Trump said, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Trump added, For more than two decades previous presidents have signed a waiver to delay moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, and while previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver, today, I am delivering. Turkeys dictator, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is at it again, threatening Israel with cutting off diplomatic relations should the Trump administration recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital. In a meeting with a parliamentary group of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Erdogan stated that, This (referring to U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital) could go as far as cutting our diplomatic relations with Israel. You cannot take such a step. He furthermore warned the Trump administration that recognizing Jerusalem would be a red line for Muslims. He suggested that Turkey will take measures in the event of a possible U.S. move, including the convening of the 57 nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Istanbul. Erdogans bluster regarding President Trumps announcement on Jerusalem included such a far-fetched statement as, Such a move would not only be a violation of international law, but also a big blow the conscience of humanity.",0
"Title: In Unanimous Decision SCOTUS Rules Police Must Get A Warrant to Search Cell Phone Data %%  Article: In a unanimous ruling the Supreme Court decided, The police generally may not, without a warrant, search digital information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been arrested. The case of Riley v. California is a consolidated case. For the Plaintiff David Leon Riley, this case began when he was stopped for a traffic violation that eventually led to weapons charges. While searching Riley, a police officer seized Rileys cell phone. Riley was faced charges related to a shooting that occurred weeks earlier based on photos and video the police officer found on his phone. The trial court denied Rileys motion to suppress the evidence obtained from his phone and he was convicted. The trial courts ruling on the motion to suppress was affirmed by The California court of Appeals. This case began for Brima Wurie when he was arrested in Boston for participating in a drug sale. The police seized his phone after they arrived at the police station. Thats when they noticed the phone was receiving several calls from a source my house. Police officers traced that phone number to what they suspected was Wuries apartment. That is when the police got a search warrant that lead to their discovery of drugs, a firearm and ammunition. As a result, Wurie faced drug and firearms charges. Like Riley, Wurie filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained because of the search warrant.",0
"Title: Fox News Labels Shakira A Liar on AZ Immigration Law %%  Article: Fox News went on the attack today against Colombian pop singer Shakira, because she was in Arizona yesterday speaking out against that states immigration law. This morning on Fox and Friends Brian Kilmeade said, We know her hips dont lie, but we arent so sure about her lips. Because the singer dared to criticize a Fox News supported policy, she now joins LL Cool J on their enemies list. Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters: Fox and Friends mockingly introduced video of Shakira in Phoenix yesterday stating her opposition to the law. She said, Im in opposition to this law because it is a violation of human and civil rights. It goes all human dignity, against the principles of most Americans that I knowI dont want to this law tarnish what this country stands for. We can not let fear and injustice take over. Steve Doocy of Fox News framed Shakira as from Columbia and hating the idea of the law. Of course, this is Fox News, so that wasnt enough. Brian Kilmeade also called her a liar. He said, We know her hips dont lie, but we arent so sure about her lips. According to Fox as any opposition to the Arizona law based on civil rights is a lie, and Shakira is a liar for stating her belief that this law is a violation of American principles. Shakira is not your usual self absorbed pop star. She is a UNICEF global ambassador. She has been honored by Oxford for her work on the issues of children and education, and she has been honored by the United Nations for her work on behalf of children, education, and social justice, but yet gets labeled a liar for stating an opinion that Fox News disagrees with.",1
"Title: Author of controversial gold standard study on gay parenting being investigated by university  Article: NewsHomosexuality July 16, 2012 (LifeSiteNews.com) - The University of Texas has launched a scientific misconduct investigation of UT sociologist Mark Regnerus, after he was accused by homosexual activists of scientific misconduct in his recent study. Regnerus study, published in the July issue of Social Science Research, found that children of homosexual parents have significantly more social and mental-health problems than children of heterosexual parents. The study has been described as a gold standard study, because of its use of a large, random sample, with responses coming from the children of opposite sex and same-sex parents. Previous studies on the subject of homosexual parenting have typically used small convenience samples, and have often relied on the responses of the parents, rather than the children. The study raised a tremendous outcry from gay rights activists, including from Scott Rosensweig, or Scott Rose, a writer on LGBTQ issues for The New Civil Rights Movement blog. The University of Texas began the investigation shortly after Rosensweig wrote an open letter to William Powers, the president of UT, claiming that Regnerus was guilty of scientific misconduct because the study was designed so as to be guaranteed to make gay people look bad, through means plainly fraudulent and defamatory. Rosensweig also accused Regnerus of being politically biased, because he received funding from institutions, such as the Witherspoon Institute and The Bradley Foundation, that are said to support traditional marriage.",0
"Title: Orange Crushed: John Boehner Melts Down After President Obama Vetoes Keystone XL %%  Article: Speaker of the House John Boehner could only react with inept rage after President Obama vetoed Keystone XL. In a statement, Boehner raged: The presidents veto of the Keystone jobs bill is a national embarrassment. Its embarrassing when Russia and China are plowing ahead on two massive pipelines and we cant get this one no-brainer of a project off the ground. The president is just too close to environmental extremists to stand up for Americas workers. Hes too invested in left-fringe politics to do what presidents are called on to do, and thats put the national interest first. For the president, Keystone may just be todays politics, but there are workers and unions who have spent years counting on the 42,000 jobs this project will support. There are small business owners counting on the promise and opportunities this project will bring to their towns. There are governors in both parties counting on the revenue and growth this project will bring to their states. There are manufacturers clamoring for the development of North Americas resources. And theres an overwhelming majority of Americans who want us to put politics aside and get this done. Everyone who pays attention to politics understood that the Republican obsession with Keystone XL was a total waste of time. It is interesting that Boehner considers the veto of the pipeline a national embarrassment when he doesnt feel the same way about the government shutdown that he spearheaded, the various debt ceiling debacles, the invasion of Iraq based on a lie that he supported, and House of Representatives that spends more time on vacation than passing laws. The national embarrassment is John Boehner.",1
"Title: Hows your Financial I.Q.? Take the test!  Article: Americas federal, state, and city governments are profligate and irresponsible with taxpayers money, over-spending themselves into declared and undeclared bankruptcy, and a national debt that now exceeds Americas GDP. But if we, the American people, are better managers of our own finances, not only would more of us realize the financial black hole government is in, we would also demand more fiscal prudence from officialdom. Alas, Hadley Malcolm reports for USA Today, April 24, 2012, that despite the recession, most Americans still know NOTHING about their finances, especially young people. Here are the facts: Americans in their 20s hold an average debt of about $45,000, which includes everything from cars to credit cards to student loans to mortgages, according to a PNC financial independence survey released last month. At the same time, Americans 18-29 year old have a much higher jobless rate of 12.4% , well above the national rate of 8.2%. Financial literacy is especially needed for young Americans because they face an increasingly complex global economy that is credit-driven and puts more responsibility on individuals to plan for and manage their retirement accounts. But too many young Americans are financial illiterates. A biennial survey by Jumpstart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy found that U.S. high school seniors scored an average of 57.3% on a 31-question financial literacy exam in 1997.",0
"Title: PragerU: Douglas Murray Explains the Suicide of Europe | Blog Posts  Article: The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity Islam, Douglas Murrays important book, continues to influence the debate on allowing mass immigration of Muslims, a historic enemy of the West. The political problem was Europes foolish invitation, led by Germanys Chancellor Merkel, to millions of dissatisfied muslims to come live in the West. But the psychological cause is a disconnect from the history of Europe civilization, which still includes the Enlightenment. Murrays analysis is that Europes elite (but not its average citizens) feel a loss of confidence about the last centurys failures of history require the penance of surrendering to the diverse hordes of the Third World. From the outside, it does seem Euro-elites are throwing in the towel on the continent with its complicated history. Murray has distilled important points from his book into a five-minute explainer for a PragerU video:  Heres a transcript of the video:  DOUGLAS MURRAY: The civilization born of Judeo-Christian values, ancient Greek philosophy and the discoveries of the Enlightenment is staring at the abyss, brought there by its own hand. To put it starkly: Europe is committing suicide. How did this happen? Its a complicated story, but there are two major causes. The first is the mass movement of peoples into Europe. This has been going on steadily since the end of World War II but sped up massively in the migration crisis of 2015, when more than a million migrants poured into Europe from the Middle East, North Africa and East Asia. The second, and equally significant, is that Europe lost faith in itselfits beliefs, its traditions and even its very legitimacy.",1

The tariffs will come into force within 15 days and are expected to draw retaliation from the EU and other steel producers and heighten fears of a descent into a trade war.",0
"Title: Mysterious elongated Skull discovered in Russia recreated in 3D  Article: Russian archaeologists have managed to recreate a computer model of the enigmatic elongated skull that was discovered in Russias Stonehenge: Arkaim. This proves that elongated skulls are a global phenomenon present all around the world. The question that remains is: Why were elongated skulls so important in the distant past? In 2015, Russian archaeologists excavating Russias Stonehenge known as Arkaim discovered a mysterious skeleton with an unusually anomalous elongated skull. After numerous studies and analysis, they have managed to recreate how the Arkaim elongated skull really looked like in the distant past. Arkaim is one of the most mysterious ancient archaeological sites in Russia. This 20.000 square meter compound was protected by circular walls just before it was burned down and abandoned mysteriously. Archaeologists believe that, just like Stonehenge in the UK, Arkaim was an ancient site dedicated to the observation of stars and constellations. Arkaim was a very sophisticated settlement, and in some cases, it displayed unique technologies that went far beyond the capabilities of other similar settlements since Arkaim had a very complex water drainage system and sedimentation pits. Researchers speculate that ancient tribes in the vicinity of Arkaim practiced head binding just as many other ancient cultures around the globe. Researcher Maria Makurova has confirmed to the Russian news agency TASS: We have found a well-preserved skeleton. Her skull was elongated because the tribe did so by tying up the heads of their children with rope.",0
"Title: Trump Rips Into Andrew McCabe & ""Sanctimonious"" James Comey  Article: President Trump took to his favorite bullhorn to express his thoughts on the firing of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew Mccabe and former FBI Director James Comey. In a series of tweets, Trump expressed his disgust with both men. ""As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State,"" Trump tweeted, reminding people of what had taken place over the past couple of years, including the unconstitutional surveillance performed against his campaign.

"Title: There Has to Be Room for Dissent Among Obama Supporters %%  Article: Theres a true story in my husbands family passed along to teach everyone a valuable lesson. His grandfather was an eccentric man who loved to gamble, his game of choice being poker. One day, he placed an outlandish bet. He put up his house. As it happens, his bluff was called, and he lost his house. But it didnt really matter if he had won. He put something on the table that didnt belong in the game. Its not like a partial cut to Social Security proposed by the President is the equivalent to giving up your entire home. However, the moral of the story is that like the house, even if youre holding an excellent hand, some things dont belong in the game, because the stakes are too high. Everyone has their sacred cows, and for many who have watched Republicans throughout their entire lives try to find some foothold into dismantling Social Security, creating a precedent where this program could be cut was one of them. We have yet to see what will happen in the fiscal negotiations, but in the meantime, there are strained relationships among liberals outside the beltway. Some have seen fit to name call, label, and denigrate anyone who disagrees with the President. In a strong democracy, reasonable criticisms of the President or other elected officials have to be considered healthy and necessary, without stigma and condemnation raining down on those who make them. There are at least two ways to criticize a President. One way I will call bagging based on the language thats already been popularized. Bagging can be defined as relentless criticism of elected officials with a simultaneous inability to recognize any of their positive contributions.",0
"Title: Troubled South Bend abortion facility to cease abortions Friday  Article: NewsAbortion South Bend, IN, November 4, 2015 (OperationRescue)  Womens Pavillion, the last abortion clinic in South Bend, Indiana, will halt abortions on Friday, November 6, 2015, making the South Bend area abortion-free. The clinics troubled owner, abortionist Ulrich Klopfer, will surrender his facility license now that he has dropped his appeal of a decision issued in June by the Indiana State Department of Health to revoke the Womens Pavillions operating license. The ISDH notified Klopfer of its intent to revoke the Womens Pavillion facility license in June after he failed to adequately correct numerous deficiencies discovered by inspectors. Klopfer still faces possible revocation of his medical license or other discipline for hundreds of violations related to failing to include required information from state reporting forms and failing to report suspected child sex abuse in a timely manner. Klopfers pattern of omitting critical information on the state-mandated reporting forms served to cover up for child rapists and made it nearly impossible for the State to investigate suspected cases of child sex abuse or determine whether the abortions done by Klopfer were within the legal gestational limits in Indiana. Womens Pavillion was raided by police serving a search warrant in March, 2014. Klopfer was criminally charged with failing to report suspected child sex abuse. We have no idea how many little girls were handed back to their abusers by Klopfer. He did everything he could to protect the rapists at the expense of the safety of little girls that depended on him to save them.",1
"Title: Dresden's annihilation shown in World War Two video  Article: Harrowing footage from World War Two showing the annihilation of the German city of Dresden by Allied forces has resurfaced on the anniversary of the bombings which killed up to 25,000 people. Video from 1945, shown as part of an American news report, shows the fearsome bomb attacks undertaken by the RAF on the night of February 13. One shot from the footage shows an RAF plane being struck by an anti-aircraft gun, which the narrator describes as a 'scarecrow' in his voiceover. The clip also shows American bombers moving over the east German city the following day, where they dropped more bombs in an effort to stop Hitler's forces fending off the Soviet advance from the east. At the start of the clip, with the American narrator describing the Allied attacks, British bombers are seen high above the Saxony city. Dresden is then seen at night, with the aerial view showing the terrifying sound and light of the explosions. One British plane falls victim to the 'scarecrow', which the narrator calls 'Goebbels's secret weapon', with a frightening explosion in the sky. Some 650,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on Dresden's transportation lines by RAF Lancaster planes, according to the narrator, hampering the German forces. The bombings then continue to ravage the city before American bombers from the Eighth Air Force are seen leaving vapour trails behind them as they join in the attack.",0
"Title: ICE Director Blasts Nancy Pelosi: ""How Dare She Say We Are Terrorizing Communities!""  Article: Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Tom Homan ripped into House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) after she made comments that President Trump had used ICE in the San Francisco Bay area to terrorize the people there. ""Just last week, President Trump decided to terrorize innocent immigrant families in the Bay Area with his unjust and cruel raids,"" Pelosi said on Wednesday, March 7 following a series of arrests of illegals by ICE. The people of California will not be bowed by the Trump administrations brazen aggression and intimidation tactics,"" the California Democrat said. ""Californians will continue to proudly keep our doors open to the immigrants who make America more American. We will fight this sham lawsuit and will fight all cowardly attacks on our immigrant communities. ""The President has now desperately decided to brazenly abuse the legal system to push his mass deportation agenda.,"" Pelosi added, forgetting that the mass deportation is part of US law. ""How dare she say we are terrorizing communities,"" Homan said. Homan pointed out that besides being in the country illegally, that of those rounded up in the Los Angeles sting 88% were already convicted criminals. Overall, in the California arrests, 81% of those arrested were also convicted criminals. Her quote was beyond the pale, Homan said. Homan responded not only to Pelosi, but to Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) who, along with Governor Jerry Brown ripped the Trump administration for doing their job on immigration.",1

"Title: Ireland About to Give Another Sop to the Banks, a Bad Assets Fire Sale?  Article: Reader Swedish Lex, who was involved in the famed and generally well regarded Swedish banking industry cleanup of the early 1990s, read an innocuous-sounding Financial Times story the same way I did. Not only are the banks who lent recklessly to Irelands overheated property sector being shielded from most of the consequences of their stupidity and greed, but other financiers are likely to make out like bandits on what looks certain to be an unduly rapid sale of bad bank assets. For readers new to how banks get euthanized, an approach generally regarded as sound when dealing with banks that are seriously insolvent (as in their assets are worth less than their debts) is the good bank-bad bank approach. The bank is taken over, the board and senior management is fired. The good parts of the bank are usually spun back out as quickly as possible with new management in place. The bad parts, typically the bad loans, are put in a separate entity and disposed of. Now there are a lot of variants on that theme. For instance, a bank might be taken over, given a government guarantee, and have its bad assets spun out gradually (as opposed to setting up a separate bad bank entity). Some Texas banks that went bust in the late 1980s had their own bad bank entities. By contrast, the S&L crisis featured one big bad bank entity, the Resolution Trust Corporation, whose mission it was to sell the asset of failed thifts. Most of these banks had gotten into trouble with speculative real estate lending (sound familiar?)",0
"Title: Gay Marriage Ruling Hasnt Dissuaded Conservatives  Article: Californians have seen it before. From the overturn of voter approved Proposition 8 and Proposition 22 to this weeks U.S. Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges to institute homosexual marriage in all 50 states, judges overruled the will of the people. Proposition 8 is the 2008 ballot measure that California voters approved 52.3% to 47.7%, upholding marriage as the union between a man and a woman. It passed in the blue state the same year liberals came out in force to elect Barack Obama the first time around. Chief U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker later overturned the measure. Fridays 5-4 Supreme Court decision to force every state to issue homosexual marriage licenses included the supportive vote of Justice Kennedy. Republican 2016 presidential candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz called the marriage ruling as well as Thursdays ruling upholding Obamacare, both naked and shameless judicial activism. Breitbart News Ben Shapiro wrote of Justice Kennedys opinion, Justice Kennedy just redefined a fundamental right and forced elected state governments to slap their stamp of approval on that right. Justice Kennedy was also one of five justices voting to overturn the President Bill Clinton signed Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 2013. As the Court struck down DOMA, it also decided to refrain from a substantive ruling on Prop 8. The lower court decision to overturn the measure stood. Justice Kennedy dissented the decision to not issue a ruling. A ruling against Prop 8 at the Supreme Court level could have invalidated similar measures in other states.",1

The first officially recorded CIA drone strikes took place in 2002 under the Bush administration, since then they have escalated dramatically, particularly since Barak Obama entered the White House in 2008. In his first four years in office, Obama authorized six times more drone strikes in Pakistan than under all eight years of the Bush Administration.

Paladino was so upset over de Blasios trip to Germany to speak at a G-20 protest in lieu of attending a vigil for slain New York police officer Miosotis Familia that she left the car to berate him. As de Blasio approached her and a group of others to shake hands, she started to ask about his trip. He turned around with his security detail and went to his car. I want to know why you let your police officers down and our country down by going to Germany and protesting against our country, she yelled at de Blasio. I want to know why youre doing that. OK?

He was more like the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard Of Oz. Paladino caught the attention of the media assembled for the event, and she told reporters that shed had it with de Blasio and doubted he had a friend in the city.

British authorities, primed with endless victimhood posturing by Muslims in Britain, were ready and willing to see British troops in Iraq as abusive, racist, Islamophobic louts, and eager to pay for such stories. This is why we see so many anti-Muslim hate crimes faked by Muslims in the U.S. and the West in general: becoming a victim brings one laudatory press attention, and in many cases money and special favors.

"Title: Would-be Caliph Erdogan: Jerusalem is our red line demands Trump return from this grave mistake immediately  Article: ANKARA: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is calling a summit of the main pan-Islamic body in Istanbul on Dec 13 to discuss the expected US move to recognise Jerusalem as Israels capital, his spokesman said on Wednesday (Dec 6). In the face of developments that arouse sensitivity over the status of Jerusalem, Mr President is calling a leaders summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in order to display joint action among Islamic countries, presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told reporters in Ankara. He said the summit meeting would take place on Dec 13. There was no immediate confirmation from Muslim leaders if they would come. Turkey currently holds the chairmanship of the OIC. The recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital and the moving of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  expected to be announced by President Donald Trump later Wednesday  would be a grave mistake against international agreements, Kalin warned. Jerusalem is our honour, Jerusalem is our common cause, Jerusalem is our red line, he added, urging the Trump administration to return from this grave mistake immediately. Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said the expected US move risked igniting a fire in the Middle East and will prove a great disaster.

"Title: Galactic Federation Delivers Ultimatum To United Nations, Threatens To Incinerate Earth If Reasonable Demands Are Not Met Within Ten Years Time!  Article: By Ray Charlston According to anonymous sources within the United Nations, last Thursday an extra-terrestrial claiming to represent the Galactic Federation, a federation of independent planets and alien races, gave a speech before the UN. This meeting was classified as top-secret by the world body, and member nations have voted not to disclose its contents. The ambassador of the Galactic Federation, whose name is unpronounceable by humans, has indicated that they have plans to incinerate Earth, if all of their reasonable demands are not met within the next ten Earth years. The Galactic Federation has demanded that Earth end all economic disparities among racial, ethnic and national groups. Quoting Karl Marx, the ambassador stated that Earths new motto must be From each according to his abilities, to each according to his need. Warning that they will not permit humans to contaminate the galaxy with racism, income inequality, or to possibly enslave and exploit the inhabitants of other planets, the Galactic Federation has also demanded that all Earth governments agree to complete nuclear disarmament. Providing instructions for how to achieve complete economic equality, the ambassador observed that Governments must engage in income redistribution. Governments must tax citizens and then redistribute funds to them in order to achieve complete equality. Explaining that humans differ in abilities, intelligence, and work ethics, it (his race reportedly has no gender) went on to note that it will take a strong and authoritarian world government in order to achieve complete equality, which is humanitys most noble aspiration.",0

Now new evidence is revealing that top Obama Administration officials coordinated with each other and the FBI to help CNN run a damaging and unverified story on Trump and the infamous salacious dossier. The mainstream media wont touch this story with a ten-foot-pole because it not only shows the unsurprising amounts of actual lies and fake news they put out daily, but it also details how CNN was used to run damaging stories at the behest of the Obama administration. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs released new emails on Monday night that allegedly show that Obama administration officials coordinated with each other to help CNN run a damaging story on President-elect Donald Trump based on salacious and unverified information contained in a politically motivated dossier financed by Trumps political enemies (Hillary Clinton and the DNC.)
