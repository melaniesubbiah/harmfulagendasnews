"Title: Ignorant US Attorney: We may never know what drove Maalik Jones to travel to Somalia and pledge allegiance to al Shabaab  Article: U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: We may never know what drove Maalik Jones to travel to Somalia and pledge allegiance to al Shabaab, a terrorist organization that has vowed to destroy America. Yes, its a real mystery! Could it have anything to do with his adhering to a religion that thrice commands believers to kill them wherever you find them (cf. Quran 2:191, 4:89, and 9:5)? Could it be related to his revering as a prophet a man who waged war against those who did not accept his prophetic claim and commanded his followers to murder people who criticized him? Nah, that couldnt be it. Its a religion of peace! Maybe he had a deprived childhood  take our poll - story continues below  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

"Title: Brave And Heroic Human Rights Activists Bust Up Racist Oktoberfest Hate-Events  Article: By Ray Charlston White people of German ancestry, and even some who are not, are gathering together, eating German food, listening to German music, and celebrating German heritage. This is disgusting, vile, and completely unacceptable. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a more obscene and offensive celebration, as people are seen waving German flags, and even wearing t-shirts emblazed with messages invoking German pride! As if Germans, of all people, had anything to be proud of. Germany has always been one of the worlds most backward, uneducated, uncultured, and unenlightened countries. In fact, German culture is merely composed of stolen elements from the cultures and mythologies of other peoples. Germany has produced no great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, artists, or composers in its entire history! German food is inedible, and the German language is one of the most guttural and awful of all to human ears! Because of past racial hate mongering and paranoia, German people are largely inbred, and possess none of the hybrid vigour of other nations. They are a race of ugly dwarves, of diminutive stature, with hideous faces, evil beady eyes and stunted small minds. Scientists and historians agree that Germans are among the dumbest people in the world, yet, paradoxically, they excel at developing diabolically evil plans for terrorizing other races and conquering their neighbours! Far from being part of some mythical Aryan master race, Germans are descended from Europes largely illiterate unwashed barbarian hordes, referred to as savages by ancient Roman writers! I am personally greatly ashamed of my own partial German heritage. Germany should be wiped off the map!",1
"Title: Saudi-American Muslim Psychiatrist Diagnoses Woman With Disobedient Wife Disorder  Article: By Ray Charlston Several weeks ago, Margaret OReilly began seeing a local psychiatrist in her city of Seattle Washington. Dr. Ahmed Abdullah Rahman is a licensed psychiatrist who originally practiced in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. He has been practicing psychiatric medicine in the US for more than 10 years. After one session, according to Mrs. OReilly, Dr. Rahman stunned her by suggesting that she was suffering from Disobedient Wife Disorder. The treatment for Disobedient Wife Disorder (or DWD), which is even more controversial, involves light beatings using a stick called a miswak. The punishment is administered by the womans husband, along with verbal admonitions from him for his wife to be obedient, or to end her rebellion. The practice is designed, allegedly, not to injure a woman or to harm her, but to shame and humiliate her into compliance. The controversial treatment is allegedly about Bringing the woman back to her senses and back to reality according to one booklet on the topic. Disobedient Wife Disorder remains a controversial diagnosis, sparking strong feelings among those on both sides of the issue. Most of the psychiatrists in the West who do accept the existence of DWD are Muslim, and this fact is often cited by Islamophobes and reactionaries. The American Psychiatric Association, as well as the American Psychological Association, both reject the diagnosis. When I began writing this article, Margaret OReilly was suing Dr. Rahman for medical malpractice. According to Mrs. OReilly I have always been progressive and strongly anti-racist. I dont have a prejudiced bone in my entire body!",1
"Title: Nintendos War on Women, Minorities and Democracy  Article: Special Investigative Report with Ray Charlston If you are like many people 30 and under you may have grown up on video games. Perhaps your family had a Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo, Gameboy, or a Nintendo 64. Perhaps you or your children own a Nintendo Wii. You may think video games are a harmless hobby or an enjoyable form of recreation, but think again! Video games can promote racism, sexism and anti-democratic attitudes! Nintendo Co. Ltd, headquartered in Kyoto Japan was literally founded on sexism, racism and Japanese Imperialism. Founded in 1889, its hateful legacy continues on to the present. Video games have spread around the world, poisoning the globe with hate. For this special report I will be interviewing Dr. Norman Frederickson of the Campaign for Justice, Equality and Peace. His organization is dedicated to fighting hatred and exposing bigotry and intolerance. RC: Dr. Frederickson, thank you for agreeing to accept this interview. NF: Of course. I was happy to accept your invitation this is a very important issue. One that I might add, I am deeply concerned about. RC: I understand that you have done extensive research into video games, Nintendo games specifically and what youve found has been, more than a little troubling? NF: Yes, indeed. Our children are being taught racism, sexism, colonialism, and even feudalism in these so-called Nintendo video games. What most people dont realize is that the Nintendo company has been around for some time, well before video games were invented. They used to make playing cards and other things. During the World War II era Nintendo like the rest of Japan was infused with Japanese Imperialism.",1
"Title: Video Surfaces Of Trump Ogling Woman & Bragging About Hiring Teen For Looks  Article: The list of sexual assault and harassment allegations against President Trump seems to be continually growing, so its not particularly surprising when a new video or recording surfaces of him saying or doing something vulgar. These examples of the presidents troubling behaviors might not surprising, but that doesnt make them any less disturbing. One such video from 2007 has resurfaced and has been making the rounds recently. The video shows a portion of Trumps San Francisco Learning Annex speech in which he boasts about hiring a beautiful girl, 17 or 18, so beautiful as a waitress even though she had no waitressing experience. Trumps remarks (for which he was paid $1.5 million) about hiring the teenage girl because she was beautiful came when an audience member who introduced herself as Juliet asked him how many jets he owned and how she could apply to be a flight attendant. Trump responded by demanding Juliet come up on stage. Once she arrived at the podium, Trump gave her a very obvious once over and then wrapped an arm around her and said, Youre hired. He then kept her pinned to his side as he began to tell the story of the teenager that he was unable to turn away because of her good looks. My people said, Mr. Trump, she has no experience, so I interviewed her anyway because she was so beautiful. I said, Do you have any experience? She goes, No, sir. I said, When can you start? He asked, isnt that terrible?",0

"Title: Veterinarian accused of having sex with more than 300 dogs  Article: A renowned veterinarian from Trenton in Missouri was arrested this morning after being filmed by a security camera while having sex with several dogs. According to the Trenton Police Department, an investigation was launched on Dr. James Thompson in January, after several dog owners filed complaints about their dogs suffering from anal bleeding after visiting his clinic. During the investigation, the police convinced the owners of the West Trenton Animal Hospital, where Dr. Thompson practiced, to install several new security cameras around the building. The police and the owners were completely shocked when they saw the video footage a few weeks later. Over a period of two weeks, Dr. Thompson was filmed sexually aggressing 19 different dogs, mostly smaller breeds like miniature poodles, bichons, and chihuahuas. TPD spokesman Lt. Frank Simmons says the aggressions were rather violent and must have been traumatizing for the animals. He would put a cone-shaped collar around the animals neck so he wouldnt get bit, then hed grab it and have sex with it in various positions. According to Lt. Simmons, the veterinarian could have made a great number of victims. After interrogating the staff and customers, we collected evidence concerning at least 300 victims, but there could be thousands over his 17 years of practice. A total of 352 criminal charges have been filed against him, and the TPD says this number will probably double over the next few days. Dr.",1
"Title: NRA Freaks Out After Obama Moves To Keep Guns Out of the Hands of Convicted Felons  Article: As expected, the National Rifle Association freaked out today after the Obama administration announced that they are going to keep the most dangerous firearms out of the wrong hands and ban almost all re-imports of military surplus firearms to private entities. Requiring background checks for corporations and trusts does not keep firearms out of the hands of criminals, NRA spokesperson Andrew Arulanandam said in a statement released on Buzzfeed. Prohibiting the re-importation of firearms into the U.S. that were manufactured 50 or more years ago does not keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. He huffed and he puffed, This administration should get serious about prosecuting violent criminals who misuse guns and stop focusing its efforts on law-abiding gun owners. (Continued Below) Yeah, wow. Sure sounds like Obama is tyrant of the highest order. Obama is taking aim at law-abiding gun owners  if by law-abiding gun owners you mean convicted felons and domestic abusers, which may be the same thing in Republican world. The ATF rule would require those who register a gun to a corporation to undergo a background check, thereby closing a loophole that permits convicted felons, domestic abusers and others who are not supposed to own guns to buy them. This loophole rule applies to convicted felons and domestic abusers.",0
"Title: Child Hunger Is Exploding In Greece  And 14 Signs That It Is Starting To Happen In America Too  Article: Michael Snyder Activist Post The world is heading into a horrific economic nightmare, and an inordinate amount of the suffering is going to fall on innocent children. If you want to get an idea of what America is going to look like in the not too distant future, just check out what is happening in Greece. At this point, Greece is experiencing a full-blown economic depression. As I have written about previously, the unemployment rate in Greece has now risen to 27 percent, which is much higher than the peak unemployment rate that the U.S. economy experienced during the Great Depression of the 1930s. And as you will read about below, child hunger is absolutely exploding in Greece right now. Some families are literally trying to survive on pasta and ketchup. But dont think for a moment that it cant happen here. Sadly, the truth is that child hunger is already rising very rapidly in our poverty-stricken cities. Never before have we had so many Americans unable to take care of themselves. Food stamp enrollment and child homelessness have soared to brand new all-time records, and there are actually thousands of Americans who are so poor that they live in tunnels underneath our cities. But for millions of other Americans, the suffering is not quite so dramatic. Instead, they just watch their hopes and their dreams slowly slip away as they struggle to find a way to make it from month to month. There are millions of parents that lead lives that are filled with constant stress and anxiety as they try to figure out how to provide the basics for their children. How do you tell a child that you cant give them any dinner even though you have been trying as hard as you can?",0
"Title: America Fundamentally Transformed  Article: In the spring of 2007 I was teaching a small class of non-traditional students, some as young as eighteen and some older than I was. It was an interesting mixture of blacks, whites, Hispanics, civilians and military who had jobs during the day and took classes at night to finish their college degrees. They were not the pampered and entitled snowflakes of today; they were hard-working Americans from all walks of life, some receiving Pell grants and some on military scholarships. We always had interesting discussions as most brought their experience to class to contribute to our economic lessons. A few detracted from it with their unruly and disrespectful behavior. It was a bit too late to teach social manners to the two young black women who always arrived late, answered their phones in the classroom, and left often for bathroom breaks but returned with sodas, hamburgers, and fries from the nearby bowling alley. Everyone was hungry, most students did not get a chance to get supper but some were patient enough to wait for the large break between the three-hour long classes before they bought food. take our poll - story continues below  Who will cave first over the government shutdown?

"Title: Turkish PMs Visit to Iraq May Give Impetus to 'Fight Against Daesh'  Article: Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim had a two-day visit to Baghdad and Erbil over the weekend. Sputnik spoke in an interview with the Deputy Chairman of the parliamentary faction of the ruling Turkish Justice and Development Party (AKP) Bulent Turan regarding the visit and its effect on the fight against terrorists in the region. Looking at the whole picture, I want to say that our recent visits to Baghdad and Erbil have been very successful and yielded more positive results than was originally expected. Iraq is our neighbor, with which Turkey has long-standing close social, cultural and historical relations, Turan said. He further said Turkey wants to work more closely with all its neighboring countries and above all with Iraq . The two countries have much work to do in the economic and political sphere as well as establish cooperation in the field of security. According to Turan, the official visit of the Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, ministers and deputies as part of the Turkish delegation for two days was carried out in close contact with the Iraqi authorities and that resulted in signing of several mutual agreements. We see that Iraq needs us and we need it.",0
"Title: Fellowship of the Minds  Article: I despise the illegal-alien-loving folks in California. From Fox News: The illegal immigrant alien and seven-time felon who was acquitted of murder and assault in the 2015 San Francisco fatal shooting of 32-year old Kate Steinle was sentenced to three years in prison on Friday. Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, who has been in custody since shortly after the shooting, was credited for time served. He will be on parole for 48 months and will remain in custody to face federal charges. The case sparked national debate over immigration reform and so-called Sanctuary Cities that shield illegals from deportation, of which San Francisco is one. The felony possession was the only conviction to come out of Garcia Zarates trial in November. The jury decided Steinles death, the result of a ricochet bullet fired from roughly 100 feet away, was an accident. At a hearing Friday, Garcia Zarate entered the courtroom wearing huge oversized bright orange sweatshirt and sweatpants. He was uncuffed and smiling as he shook the hand of each member of his defense team, including new attorney Tony Serra. His attorneys requested a new trial, but the judge denied the motion. Garcia Zarate is expected to be turned over to U.S.",1
"Title: Broward County Accepts Islamist Blood Money for School Shooting  Article: The Broward Education Foundation (BEF) has set up a fund to assist the survivors and the families of the victims of last months Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which took the lives of 17 innocent students and faculty. The fund has accepted money from many sources, including a group, the South Florida Muslim Federation, that acts as an umbrella organization for a number of smaller groups, many of which have numerous links to terrorism and bigotry. On March 5th, the Broward County Public Schools (BCPS) Superintendent Robert Runcie and BEF Executive Director Shea Ciriago held, up high, a check containing the South Florida Muslim Federation (SFMF) logo for $15,668. The money was raised via a page set up by SFMF on the crowdfunding site, LaunchGood. A dozen Muslim associates from the group came for the photo op and to present the check. A page on the SFMF website has been created to publicize the check presentation. On it are mentioned a number of SFMF groups that helped coordinate the raising of the funds. They include: the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA), the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), Islamic Relief (IR), and the Islamic Foundation of South Florida (IFSF). CAIR was established in June 1994 by operatives from Hamas, including then-global leader of Hamas, Mousa Abu Marzook. In 2007 and 2008, CAIR was named a co-conspirator by the US Justice Department for two federal trials dealing with the financing of millions of dollars to Hamas. CAIR had used its official website to raise money for the organization on trial, the Holy Land Foundation (HLF).",1
"Title: Woman who became the UKs oldest mom by IVF now admits it was a mistake  Article: NewsBioethics UK, March 26, 2012, (LifeSiteNews.com) - Susan Tollefsen, who caused an uproar when she became Britains oldest first-time mother in 2008, now says achieving pregnancy at age 57 by IVF was a mistake, and is calling for all IVF clinics to set an age limit of 50. Tollefsen, a retired teacher, became pregnant using sperm from her one-time partner Nick Mayer, who is 11 years her junior, and a donor egg. The media reported at the time that she and Mayer spent 15,000 on fertility treatment in Russia after they were refused by British clinics because of her age. A daughter, Freya, was born by Caesarean section in March 2008. Tollefsen and Mayer are now separated due to what she told the media was the shock to their relationship of having a child so late in life. Tollefsen, now 61, revealed to the Telegraph newspaper that during a serious illness over Christmas she was not able to care for 4-year-old Freya, and came to the realization that she might not live long enough to raise her child. I was so ill, I literally thought I was dying. I kept thinking about Freya - and for the first time, I realized I might not be there for her any more, she said. Its so true that you learn from your mistakes, and my mistake was not having her sooner.",0

"Title: Mitt Romneys Ohio Problem  Article: Weve all heard the axiom, as goes Ohio, so goes the nation. In fact, no Republican has ever won the Presidency without winning Ohio. And for this years GOP presidential primary, Ohio is the top prize in what is turning out to be a critical Super Tuesday on March 6th. In fact, just yesterday analyst Sean Trende of Real Clear Politics identified Ohio as the key state between a Romney runaway and the possibility of a brokered convention. So the viability of a three-way split probably comes down to Ohio, which has a fair number of evangelicals, though not to the degree that Tennessee, Oklahoma and Georgia do. Santorum has some strengths he can draw on in the Buckeye State, as his blue-collar message could play well even among Republicans there. If he wins, it means that we probably do have a deeply divided GOP, with Gingrich taking the anti-Romney vote in the South, and Santorum taking the anti-Romney vote in the Midwest. So with Ohio holding such incredible importance to Mitt Romneys hopes of becoming President, why is he betraying the very Ohio conservatives he needs to assure victory? Let me explain. As many of you may have read already, Ohio Republicans are currently in the midst of a major power struggle between moderate Ohio Republican Party Chairman Kevin DeWine and Governor John Kasich, Ohio House Speaker William Batchelder, and other conservative elected officials. Conservatives are up in arms against DeWine for a number of offenses, such as actively working against Governor Kasich in the mainstream media, by working to divert fundraisers away from Kasich near the end of his close battle against incumbent Gov.",0
"Title: Senator Kamala Harris Endorses Protecting Child Rapists  Article: California is the future. Just take it from the Senator from the one party state who is spending a lot of money to become Obama II. Kamala isn't very happy that Attorney General Sessions is taking on her regime's illegal alien voting bloc. ""This Administration and Jeff Sessions in particular have clearly put a target on the back of California and Californias going to fight,"" Harris proclaimed. ""And, I think that these folks are really mired in rolling back the clock in time and thats not going to happen. California represents the future. And -- and they dont like it, but there you go."" So the future is a bankrupt one party state made up of illegal aliens and tech tycoons, run by by the pal of one of the country's worst child murderers, building a light rail to nowhere and passing universal health care it can't afford while running all its major decisions by the nurses' union? Won't somebody think of the child rapists? Harris said she supported the mayor of Oakland to warn illegal immigrants of an impending ICE race because she is making a decision based on her ""estimation of whats in the best interest of their constituents."" The beneficiaries of that warning included personal participants in the War on Women. One Mexican citizen had convictions for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor and a conviction for driving under the influence (DUI), and had been deported in 2003. Another who evaded capture had a conviction for sodomizing a drugged victim in 2012, as well as a DUI from this year -- that Mexican citizen had also been previously deported in 2013. These are the ""constituents"" of the Democrats.",1
"Title: Researchers conclude: Proxima B has OCEANS and may well harbour ALIEN LIFE  Article: According to researchers, the second Earth, aka Proxima B has vast oceans covering its surface and may harbor alien life. Experts from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) concluded that it si very likely that the rocky planet discovered in the habitable zone of its star is covered by oceans. Researchers discovered Proxima B in August and believe it is the first exoplanet that is within our reach. The alien world is located just over 4 light-years from Earth. It is believed to have a mass 1.4 times that of Earth and orbits its host star at a distance of 7.5 million kilometers, which is one-tenth of the distance between Mercury and our Sun, or 5 percent the distance between our planet and the Sun. Proxima B takes just 11.2 days to complete an orbit around its host star. Contrary to what one might expect, such proximity does not necessarily mean that Proxima Bs surface is too hot for water to exist in liquid form, said a CNRS statement. The Host Star Proxima Centauriis smaller and around 1000 times weaker when compared to our sun.",0
"Title: Florida School Officer Filmed on Rooftop Pretending to Kill Children  Article: Doral, FL  A video has recently surfaced causing outrage from parents and backlash at a Florida school district as it shows the school resource officer on top of the schools roof, pretending to shoot the students below. The chilling gesture is now the subject of an investigation. A student at Ronald Reagan High School in Doral filmed the disturbing scene and then uploaded it to Snapchat. In the video, the officer pretends to pick up a rifle and then takes aim at the kids below. Naturally, once parents saw the video, they were in shock. Here is the taxpayer-funded public servantwho is ostensibly there to protect their childrenand he is pretending to snipe them. I have fear now going to school, and I dont want that, said student Sophia Urena. Given the timing of the release of the videodays after a deadly school massacre in Parkland, FLit has parents speaking out. Our kids dont need to be around that, a parent told 7 News. The security is supposed to protect and make my kids feel safe, and to be acting like they have guns shooting down at them, I mean, its not something they would feel safe about. Theyre concerned. According to school officials, the video was taken weeks ago but has only recently surfaced. Miami-Dade School officials told 7News that the officer has been suspended and is the subject of an investigation. They said in a statement, The employee has been removed from the school and will not be returning pending the outcome of an investigation. Because the employees actions demonstrated a serious lack of judgment, the outcome of the investigation could result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.",0
"Title: America is F___ Racist, Men are Garbage, #CancelWhitePeople: New York Times Hire  Article: While some in the ""conservative"" media are defending racist New York Times writer Sarah Jeong, Robert Stacy McCain notes that she isn't just a racist, but has a history of ugly views toward various groups. She responded to the 2014 race riot in Ferguson, Missouri, by aiming obscenities at the police and declaring America is fking racist. This rhetoric was not a response to harassment, nor was Ms. Jeong mimicking anyone as satire. Her anti-police sentiments, like her anti-Christian sentiments, are evidently sincere... In July 2014, she tweeted a question: hey whats worse, a man who calls himself a feminist, or a man who refuses to call himself a feminist? To which she answered: its a trick question all men are equally garbage in my eyes. She has declared men are innately, unintentionally garbage (Feb. 24, 2015) and men are fountains of meaningless garbage and they see every woman as an open landfill for their thoughts (April 22, 2015)... A minute later, she added another tweet: Being a straight woman is like being attracted to garbage heaps made of radioactive arsenic. McCain specifically attacks the excuse, given by the Times and Jeong that this was just trolling. (The excuse never passed muster for the alt-right, I don't see why it should for the alt-left.) This was not counter-trolling or satire, this was the declaration of a committed feminist ideologue, and her various anti-white comments (e.g., Dumbass fking white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs psing on fire hydrants) are entirely consistent with her general worldview. And Andrew Sullivan, of all people, calls this out for the garbage excuse that it is.",1
"Title: Shooting Survivor: CNN Gave Me A Scripted Question After Denying Question Of Armed Guards  Article: This is yet another propaganda alert coming straight from one of the survivors of the Florida school shooting. He says CNN gave him a scripted question after denying him the right to ask about armed guards. According to Real Clear Politics, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Colton Haab said he was approached by CNN to ask a question at Wednesday nights town hall but decided not to after the network gave him a scripted question, and quashing the one he wrote himself. Haab, a member of the Junior ROTC who shielded students while the school was under attack from the shooter, said he was going to ask about using veterans as armed security guards. That doesnt fit CNNs narrative, however, so they disallowed Haab from simply asking his question. CNN had originally asked me to write a speech and questions and it ended up being all scripted, Haab told WPLG-TV. I dont think that its going get anything accomplished. Its not gonna ask the true questions that all the parents and teachers and students have. I expected to be able to ask my questions and give my opinion on my questions, Haab said. Colton Haab, a member of the Junior ROTC who shielded classmates in the midst of terror says he did not get to share his experience, WPLGs Janine Stanwood explained. Colton wrote questions about school safety, suggested using veterans as armed school security guards but claims CNN wanted him to ask a scripted question instead so he decided not to go, Stanwood reported. So what was CNNs response? CNN did not, and does not, script any questions for town hall meetings, ever. Anyone believing CNN has an agenda other than that of the anti-gun global elites is not paying attention.",0
"Title: North Korea Executes Prominent General For Racist Comments  Article: By Ray Charlston A shocking racist incident took place in Pyongyang, North Korea, Tuesday of last week. Basketball player Dennis Rodman returned to the DPRK, at the special invitation of General Kim Jong-un, who himself is an avid and long time basketball fan. Rodman had been invited to attend a state parade in honor of North Korean basketball players. This extravagant eight-hour long parade, featured what is believed to be the largest inflatable basketball ever created. According to some South-Korean analysts, attendance at the parade, as well as flag waving, was reported to be compulsory for all Pyongyang residents. Jung Go-Wong, a prominent middle-aged general in the Korean Peoples Army, was to introduce Rodman who was invited to say a few words before the beginning of the event. Not realizing that his microphone was turned on already, the general turned to his wife and stated that Korean people are uniquely virtuous, owing to the purity of our blood since ancient times. Rodman is nothing but a dumb ugly ape! I dont know why Kim Jong-un would invite this beast to visit again. I am so tired of him and his stupid monkey antics, he belongs in a zoo! Last time Rodman was this drunk he was defecating in the hotel hallway! The aghast audience, including the Korean public as well as top North Korean officials reportedly looked on in horror as they were subjected to outrageous racist hate speech. Technicians struggled to find a way to cut the microphone, as the ghastly and obscene verbal offense continued. General Jung Go-Wong went on to say to his wife Did you see the way he looked at our daughter?",1

Spence-Jones, whos arranged some sweeeet downtown land deals for wealthy contributors, at first proposed an ordinance to require police permits to gather on public property. Then she visited Umoja. Several times, it turns out.

"Title: Hungarians welcome baby born to brain dead mother  Article: NewsFaith, Family November 21, 2013 (HLI) - In a very rare event earlier this year, a pregnant women in Hungary who was declared brain dead was kept alive for three months on life support by doctors until her baby could be safely born. The 31-year-old expectant mother suffered a stroke and was transported by a helicopter to the Neurological Clinic of Debrecen in Eastern Hungary. While the surgery was initially considered a success, sadly, she was declared brain dead two days later. An ultrasound showed that her 15-week-old preborn child was alive and very active. In the first two days we fought to save the mothers life and it was proven  that circulation and functions stopped, said Dr. Bla Flesdi, president of the University of Debrecen Medical and Health Science Centre. On the second day when [other] examinations were carried out, we found the baby was alive and kicking well in its mothers body. Dr. Tams Szilveszter Kovcs, one of the physicians who cared for the mother and child, struggled for a time over the situation, as he was unsure whether helping a baby live when the mother died was in the best interests of the child. But after meeting with the father and grandparents he changed his mind: They convinced me that the child would mean, paradoxically, a special surviving of the mother for the grieving father and the grandparents.",0
"Title: African-American Twelve Year Old Shot By Racist White Cop In Detroit In Holiday Tragedy  Article: By Werombi Towradji Acqwon Williams, a bright twelve year old African-American boy, was brutally shot by a racist white police officer on Friday. Authorities claim that the youth had entered the Detroit Plaza Mall, and had begun harassing a mall Santa Claus. Some white witnesses allege that Williams told the Santa that he had been good all year long, but barely got shit last year. In his long angry tirade, white witnesses claim that he told the mall Santa he was going to bust a cap in his fat white ass if he failed to comply with his demands for presents. Two female assistants, dressed as elves, allege that Williams groped them aggressively and made lewd and off-color remarks to them. When the mall Santa, Bill Jones, told Williams that he wasnt really Santa Claus, Williams is said to have responded I know youre the mother fucker! You are going to give me what I want white bitch, or Im about to lose my patience and do some damage you wont recover from! Dont fuck around with me you white cracka mother fucker! Williams then brandished a semi-automatic handgun and presented Jones with a Christmas list, outlining the various gifts he hoped to receive. The list reportedly included, among other things, lots of white hoes, kegs of beer, assault rifles, Jay-Z CDs, a subscription to Hustler magazine, a home entertainment system, video games, marijuana, crack cocaine, heroin, knives, a box of cigars and gangster clothes. Stating that he deserved all the items on his list, Williams expounded on the difficult year that he had endured.

"Title: On Same Day Trump Releases Nunes' Memo, Federal Judge Keeps Comey Memos Secret  Article: On the same day the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released the Nunes memo showing the FBI relied on the salacious and unverified Trump dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant on Carter Page, a federal judge ruled to withhold the Comey memos. The memos, authored by former FBI Director James Comey, are about his nine private conversations with President-elect and President Trump. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who ruled in favor of the FBIs request to keep the Comey memos secret, also sits on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The FISA Court is the same court that approved the surveillance on Trump associates. Boasberg refused to release the documents on the basis they were still being used by special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation of the alleged Russian collusion with Trump associates. The judge ruled, the Comey Memos, at least for now, will remain in the hands of the Special Counsel and not the public. Its unfortunate, but not at all surprising, to see a FISA court judge side with secrecy over transparency on the very day the House Intelligence Committee released a very troubling example of abuse of trust within the FISA system, said Christopher Bedford, the editor-in-chief of TheDCNF. On March 16, one week after Trump fired Comey, the public first learned the former FBI director had penned a memo on a Feb. 14 Oval Office meetings with President Trump. Comey told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 8 testimony that he authored secret memos of all his meetings and conversations with President-elect and President Trump.",0

Thank you! Al-Sadoon said: It was all about money  people exaggerating sometimes what they see. He blamed the British legal system for making it so easy. Indeed. British authorities, primed with endless victimhood posturing by Muslims in Britain, were ready and willing to see British troops in Iraq as abusive, racist, Islamophobic louts, and eager to pay for such stories. This is why we see so many anti-Muslim hate crimes faked by Muslims in the U.S. and the West in general: becoming a victim brings one laudatory press attention, and in many cases money and special favors. It was a racket, all of it indeed. It was a racket, all of it: Iraqi refugee admits faking hundreds of compensation claims against British troops while working for man paid 1.6m by law firm, by Miles Dilworth, Daily Mail, February 14, 2018 (thanks to David):  An Iraqi refugee has admitted arranging hundreds of fake abuse claims against British soldiers in Iraq. Basim Al-Sadoon, 37, said the racket he was involved in was aimed at winning payouts from the Ministry of Defence. Mr Al-Sadoon ran an office in Basra where he handled accusations made by locals against the British Army. He said clients exaggerated claims, produced bogus paperwork and falsely accused soldiers of wrongdoing. It was a racket, all of it, he told The Sun. All these people cared about was money.

I'm an American, not only a Latino, Villaraigosa said in a recent interview with Newsweek. I love this country. With the election still a year away, Villaraigosa, who appeared on the cover of Newsweek after becoming Los Angeles' first Latino mayor in 2005, already faces a long road to Sacramento. His chief opponent, former mayor of San Francisco and current Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, a so-called golden boy of California politics, is out-polling and out-fundraising him. ....Last month, his campaign released a 12-minute video created by Mark Putnam, the director behind one of Barack Obama's famous 30-minute campaign video during the 2008 presidential election.

Yukiko Kunitake, a 38-year Fukuoka native, gave birth to a 7.7-meter long tapeworm that had apparently parasitized her body for up to 16 years believe experts. The woman who was in excruciating pain and who believed she was in labor even underwent an epidural anesthesia to relieve the pain. The 482-pound woman said she had no idea the parasite was in her body and burst into tears when she learned she wasnt pregnant at all. I thought it was my babys umbilical cord, but they kept pulling and pulling and nothing came out, she told reporters in tears.

Everybody said I was too fat to carry a child, I was so proud to prove them wrong, she said, visibly disheartened.

"Title: Ireland About to Give Another Sop to the Banks, a Bad Assets Fire Sale?  Article: Reader Swedish Lex, who was involved in the famed and generally well regarded Swedish banking industry cleanup of the early 1990s, read an innocuous-sounding Financial Times story the same way I did. Not only are the banks who lent recklessly to Irelands overheated property sector being shielded from most of the consequences of their stupidity and greed, but other financiers are likely to make out like bandits on what looks certain to be an unduly rapid sale of bad bank assets. For readers new to how banks get euthanized, an approach generally regarded as sound when dealing with banks that are seriously insolvent (as in their assets are worth less than their debts) is the good bank-bad bank approach. The bank is taken over, the board and senior management is fired. The good parts of the bank are usually spun back out as quickly as possible with new management in place. The bad parts, typically the bad loans, are put in a separate entity and disposed of. Now there are a lot of variants on that theme. For instance, a bank might be taken over, given a government guarantee, and have its bad assets spun out gradually (as opposed to setting up a separate bad bank entity). Some Texas banks that went bust in the late 1980s had their own bad bank entities. By contrast, the S&L crisis featured one big bad bank entity, the Resolution Trust Corporation, whose mission it was to sell the asset of failed thifts. Most of these banks had gotten into trouble with speculative real estate lending (sound familiar?)",0
"Title: CAIR vs. Ex-Muslim Anni Cyrus  Article: Editor's note: To learn more about Anni Cyrus, visit her site at LiveUpToFreedom.com. The Massachusetts chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) sent out a press release last Friday, calling upon the American Legion Nonantum Post 440 in Newton, Massachusetts to cancel an event featuring Aynaz Anni Cyrus, an ex-Muslim from Iran. Cyrus crime? She knows too much about Islam, and particularly about the institutionalized mistreatment of women under Islamic law, and isnt afraid to speak frankly about what she knows. Said CAIR-MA Executive Director John Robbins: While every American has the right to free speech  even the kind of bigoted and misinformed speech offered by Ms. Cyrus  credible organizations like the American Legion should not provide platforms that imply approval or offer credibility to hate-filled views. CAIR makes similar efforts to shut down any speaker who speaks unwelcome truths about Islam, jihad and Sharia wherever theyre given a mainstream platform, and always claims that these speakers are bigoted and misinformed. When applying these labels to Anni Cyrus, however, CAIR runs into a problem: Cyrus was born in Iran and grew up in the Islamic Republic. Not only was she a Muslim, but she experienced Islam in a nation whose government prides itself on its strict application of Sharia rules. Thus if anyone knows Islam, its Anni Cyrus. Her views are just the opposite of bigoted and misinformed: they were shaped by her own bitter experience. To be sure, the CAIR press release contains a list of inaccurate, defamatory and inflammatory claims about Islam and Muslims that Cyrus has supposedly made, including:  Rape is part of Islam.",1
"Title: Jeff Sessions in El Salvador to Tackle MS-13, Shows Coordination with White House  Article: Attorney General Jeff Sessions made a previously unannounced trip to the home base of the savage MS-13 gang Thursday: San Salvador, El Salvador. Sessions met with local partners in the Central American country as the White House held its own press conference discussing the transnational criminal organization responsible for a wave of third-world brutality across the United States. As Sessions met with Salvadoran President Salvador Snchez Cern and the attorneys general of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala on strategy to combat the group, his department announced that the Salvadoran government had charged 113 MS-13 members in a sweep that netted 593 total gangsters in the war torn nation. MS-13, the popular name for Mara Salvatrucha, grew out of Salvadoran refugee communities in Los Angeles, California, many of whom fled to this country in the 1980s to escape El Salvadors horrific civil war and the right-wing death squads operating throughout Central America at the time. The gang is now estimated to have tens of thousands of members in the United States and throughout Central America. MS-13 is suspected of responsibility in numerous crimes of shocking barbarity in previously peaceful communities across the United States. In suburban Long Island, New York, in April, four men, ages 16-20, were tortured and mutilated to the point that their tattoos had to be used to identify them in a suspected MS-13 implementation of La Programma  The Program  the gangs term for a doctrine of rape, murder, torture designed to discourage any competitors in criminal enterprises.",1
"Title: Projecting Western Logic Onto Palestinians  Article: Tom Friedman is a star columnist at the New York Times with a big ego to boot. Last week in a piece titled Hamas, Netanyahu, and Mother Nature, he displayed his biased views on Israels Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israel. Friedman blames the Israeli government for doing nothing to advance peace, a charge that is totally misplaced. Every Israeli government since the Oslo Accords were signed on the White House lawn in 1993, has attempted to reach a peace deal with the Palestinians. Prime Minister Ehud Barak made far reaching concessions at Camp David in July, 2000. Noted historian Benny Morris wrote in The New York Review of Books (June 21, 2002) that Israel proposed the establishment of a demilitarized Palestinian state on some 92 percent of the West Bank and 100 percent of the Gaza Strip, with some territorial compensation for the Palestinians from pre-1967 Israeli territory; the dismantling of most of the settlements and the concentration of the bulk of the settlers inside the 8 percent of the West Bank to be annexed by Israel; the establishment of the Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, in which some Arab neighborhoods would become sovereign Palestinian territory and others would enjoy functional autonomy; Palestinian sovereignty over half the Old City of Jerusalem (the Muslim and Christian quarters) and custodianship, though not sovereignty, over the Temple Mount; a return of refugees to the prospective Palestinian state though with no right of return to Israel proper; and the organization by the international community of a massive aid program to facilitate the refugees rehabilitation.

"Title: The Republican Plan To Bail On The Presidential Debates Has Completely Backfired %%  Article: RNC Chairman Reince Priebus was trying to use the planned Hillary Clinton programs on CNN and NBC as an excuse to cut down on the number of 2016 debates. Instead, his plan has completely backfired. Chairman Priebus sent letters to CNN and NBC demanding that they cancel respectively a documentary and a mini-series about Hillary Clinton. Priebus threatened that if these programs were not canceled, there would be no Republican primary debates on CNN and NBC. Here is the RNC letter to CNN: GOPCNN Priebus had three goals when he sent the letter. He is already trying to build in an excuse for Republicans losing the 2016 election. (The media was in the bag for Hillary.) Priebus was trying to motivate the Republican base with cries of liberal media bias, and most importantly, he was looking for an excuse to cancel Republican primary debates. The head of the RNC is convinced that Republicans lost because they reached too many voters. Part of his big plan to remake the GOP after their 2012 defeat is to build up a front runner and wrap up the nomination early by limiting the number of primary debates. Priebus recently admitted to Fox News that his party cant handle the scrutiny of the primary process: On Fox News, Priebus lashed out at the number of debates and moderators, I think 23 debates is ridiculous, but the second thing that is ridiculous is allowing moderators, who are not serving the best interests of the candidate and the party, to actually be the people to be deposing our people.",0
"Title: America's Immigration Voice.  Article: What caused the FBI to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign in July 2016, which evolved into the criminal investigation that is said today to imperil the Trump presidency? As James Comey's FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller have, for 18 months, failed to prove Donald Trump's ""collusion"" with the Kremlin, what was it, in mid-2016, that justified starting this investigation? What was the basis for the belief Trump was colluding, that he was the Manchurian candidate of Vladimir Putin? What evidence did the FBI cite to get FISA court warrants to surveil and wiretap Trump's team? Republican congressmen have for months been demanding answers to these questions. And, as Mueller's men have stonewalled, suspicions have arisen that this investigation was, from the outset, a politicized operation to take down Trump. Feeding those suspicions has been the proven anti-Trump bias of investigators. Also, wiretap warrants of Trump's team are said to have been issued on the basis of a ""dirty dossier"" that was floating around town in 2016--but which mainstream media refused to publish as they could not validate its lurid allegations. Who produced the dossier? Ex-British spy Christopher Steele , whose dirt was delivered by ex-Kremlin agents. And Steele was himself a hireling of Fusion GPS, the oppo research outfit enlisted and paid by the Clinton campaign and DNC. Writes the Washington Times, Steele ""paid Kremlin sources with Democratic cash."" Yet, if Steele's dossier is a farrago of falsehoods and fake news, and the dossier's contents were used to justify warrants for wiretaps on Trump associates, Mueller has a problem.",0

Oh, wait, that hasn't happened. Why hasn't that happened? Unlike the leftist, liberal, progressive, intolerant for everything American loony toons, law-abiding citizens and constitutionalists believe in the rule of law meaning unruly riotous street protests across the nation are seen as the wrong method to affect change. Despite the leftist, liberal, progressive, intolerant population's use of these tactics to undermine the rule of law and advance political ideology anathema to our Constitution, law-abiding citizens understand these tactics would not work in the current political climate where law is what the Democrat Party of Hussein Soetoro and Hillary Clinton decide it to be at the time.

"Title: Irwin vs. Fletcher on China  Article: (Before It's News) Heres a letter to The Huffington Post: Ian Fletcher writes that What progress against poverty has occurred in the world in recent decades has not been due to free trade, but due to the embrace of mercantilism and industrial policy by some poor nations. According to the World Bank, the entire net global decline in the number of people living in poverty since 1981 has been in mercantilist China, where free trade is spurned (Free Trade Isnt Helping World Poverty, March 19) Overlook the unbelievable claim, allegedly taken from World Bank data (for which Mr. Fletcher offers neither link nor citation), that China alone is responsible for the past 30 years of the globes net decline in number of people living in poverty. Focus instead on Mr. Fletchers assertion that Chinas recent growth is due to that countrys embrace of mercantilism and its spurning of free trade. This assertion is simply wrong. While its true that China  like nearly every other nation on earth  has in place a plethora of growth-inhibiting mercantilist policies, the overwhelming economic story in China over the past 33 years is the liberalization of its markets  a liberalization that includes dramatic reductions in trade barriers. Heres economist Douglas Irwin: In December 1978 China began to end its policy of economic isolation. Under the leadership of Deng Xiaopeng, the government decollectivized agriculture, allowed private entities to trade, and permitted foreign investment.

"Title: GOP speaker on Moore accusers: Fabrication, falsehood and forgery  Article: The sexual misconduct allegations against Senate candidate Roy Moore are little more than scurrilous attacks emanating from forces within the national media and political establishments intent on robbing Alabama conservatives of influence in the coming special election. That was the heart of an impassioned message delivered by Janet Porter, president of the conservative Faith2Action network, at a Republican Party event in Cullman, Ala., Saturday. In Alabama, Porter is an outsider herself but the Ohio resident told the crowd she visited the state to stump for Moore because she believes his values align best with conservatives throughout the country. I came to Alabama  because this is ground zero in the culture war for where were going to go in the United States of America, she said. The Alabama election, she added, has implications for conservatives far beyond the states borders. This Senate race is winner take all, Porter added, noting that a Moore loss means big hurdles for a conservative agenda already imperiled by a razer thin margin in the Senate. The Moore supporter explained that losing the Senate seat up for grabs will make it harder for the Trump administration to achieve conformation for key appointments for the remainder of the presidents term. That, according to the speaker, is especially important with regard to the Supreme Court, where many conservatives believe President Donald Trump has his best opportunity to solidify a conservative legacy.",0

"Title: Food Inflation Comes To America: General Mills, Kraft And Kellogg Hike Prices On Selected Food Products  Article: After denying for months that surging food prices will eventually come to the consumer, hoping that instead food companies could absorb the margin drop, sellside research is finally capitulating to the reality of what is really happening in the retail store. In a note discussing General Mills, Goldman Sachs says the company raised prices on snack bars some 7% last week. Goldman further clarifies that ""this reportedly followed a comparable increase taken by K on its snack bars in mid-December. In addition, KFT has reportedly announced a 6% increase on select Planters branded nut products. We expect more price increases to be announced by the food companies in the coming weeks."" Maybe, but the Chairman sure doesn't. And the Chairman is always 100% correct. Other observations from Goldman on what are now seen as inevitable price increases across numerous food verticals. These pricing actions support our Food sector view that price momentum will continue to build as 2011 progresses, driven by easing promotional spending and list price increases (see our 1/5 report, Time to embrace inflation; Upgrade Food to Neutral, GIS to buy). This should drive top-line acceleration and margin stabilization over the course of 2011.

"Title: Chinas Communist Party makes persecuting Christians a priority  Article: Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. Religious experts say China, a country where only state-approved religious exercise is permitted, has one of the fastest growing Christian congregations in the world. The country is on track to have more than 250 million Christians a huge majority of them worshiping in forbidden underground churches by 2030. Unfortunately, Chinas leaders consider the growing religious population a threat to its authoritarian government. Those leaders are setting the stage for what may become one of the biggest religious persecution campaigns in modern history. A 2014 report from The Telegraph declared that the officially-atheist communist country would become the worlds most Christian nation in the next 15 years. But Chinas Christian community is also one of the worlds most imperiled faith groups in the world. For Chinese Christians who opt to worship in churches which have gained the governments seal of approval (only about 30 million of them, according to estimates), a typical service is rife with government propaganda and takes place under the watchful eye of surveillance cameras forcibly installed by the government. Worshipers and church leaders who fail to carry out their faith in a way that pleases the government are frequently attacked, beaten and arrested by police. In recent years, the country has also taken to destroying crucifixes on display in Chinese provinces, confiscating church property, levying hefty arbitrary fines and fees against churches or simply razing places of worship which displease the countrys totalitarian leaders.",1
