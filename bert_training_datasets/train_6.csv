"Title: Man turns himself in to the FBI for killing Abraham Lincoln in 1865  Article: Washington, D.C. | A man from Virginia turned himself in at the FBI headquarters this morning, claiming that he was guilty of killing more than 30 people, including the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. 71-year old Leroy Timothy Anderson, claims he worked for 35 years as a time traveling assassin for a secret governmental agency, and says he has killed people in various times, going from 1678 to 2239. The elderly man declared that his actions were all legitimate and ordered by the government, but that he fears his former employers might want to eliminate him because he knows too much. He claims that he was part a program called the Chronos Project, which was designed, coordinated, and executed by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States special operations forces, under the supervision of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). This ultra-secret program would have orchestrated more than 1200 assassinations, spreading out over almost all of human history, including many famous characters like Martin Luther King Jr, Julius Cesar or Mahatma Gandhi. His story was clearly one of the most fascinating that I have ever heard, said FBI director, James Corney. Mr. Anderson not only claims to have killed President Lincoln, but also 32 others, including at least twelve are not even born yet. I know that conspiracy theorists will accuse us of covering up Lincolns murder and stuff like that, but the FBI isnt going to open an investigation.",0
"Title: Senator Flake's Sad, Pathetic and Ignorant Speech  Article: Senator Flake, a politician who works hard at pretending to believe something, gave a speech attacking the President of the United States for criticizing the media. This Doonesbury character come to life 'courageously' delivered a speech defending major media conglomerates and their right to override elections. Because he loves freedom and truth. The speech perfectly captured Flake's insipid cluelessness. It reads like it was written by a college sophomore who is very passionate about ideas, but doesn't actually understand them. Take his opening. ""Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident ..."" So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America."" It's an applause line, but no one's applauding except the leftist media that hates the founders and Jefferson. It's also a line that could have only been produced by googling, ""founders"" and ""truth"". Jefferson wasn't writing about truth, as Flake invokes it, but about the principles on which this nation is based. And he's saying that being self-evident, they don't require further philosophical proofs. It has nothing to do with ""shared facts between the governed and the government."" That's a creepy prog idea with a whiff of 1984.",1
"Title: Critics: Its 1929 again! as Trump announces farmer bailout  Article: President Donald Trumps insanely bad policy of engaging in a trade war with China just got worse. Hes now announced hes spending $12 billion on a short term stimulus plan  read corporate welfare  to prop up farmers hurt by the trade war. Chinas retaliation for tariffs on its products was to place levies on 545 categories of U.S. products ranging from soybeans, pork, chicken and seafood to sport-utility vehicles and electric vehicles. As a result, orders for product have been cut, backing up inventory and causing export prices to plunge. It was apparently Trumps plan all along to set up a bailout for farmers. Back in April he instructed Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to devise a plan to mitigate any financial damage to farmers bottom line. The aid package will consist of direct payments, food purchases and trade development, with more details on the program to come by Labor Day, according to Perdue and top officials. Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse (NeverTrump Republican) said Trumps plan was going to make it 1929 again. Trumps trade war is cutting the legs out from under farmers, Sasse said. And the White House will now spend $12 billion on gold crutches. Americas farmers dont want to be paid to lose  they want to win by feeding the world. This administrations tariffs and bailouts arent going to make America great again, theyre just going to make it 1929 again, Sasse said in a statement. Weve already told you that tariffs are a tax on the American people and a protection racket for crony businesses. Now the government will print more money (another tax) to prop up farmers being hurt by bad policy. This means the American people are being double taxed.",0
"Title: Planned Parenthood Workers That Reached Abortion Sales Quota Goals Were Rewarded With Pizza Parties  InvestmentWatch  Article: By Michael Snyder Could you imagine having a job where you had to meet an abortion sales quota every month? According to a shocking new investigation, this was actually happening at Planned Parenthood clinics all over the nation, and workers that reached abortion sales quota goals were rewarded with pizza parties and other incentives. Every year, Planned Parenthood murders hundreds of thousands of precious little children, but that isnt good enough for them, and so they have their workers aggressively push abortions to the vulnerable young women who come into their facilities. It is a national disgrace, and Planned Parenthood should be defunded by Congress immediately. But of course Planned Parenthood was never defunded after it was revealed that they systematically harvest baby parts and sell them off to the highest bidder, and so many observers are pessimistic that they will be defunded now. In this video, women that used to work for Planned Parenthood explain how the abortion sales quotas worked. This is evil that is on a level that is hard to put into words America will never, ever be great again as long as this kind of thing is allowed to happen. As you can see in the video, former Planned Parenthood center manager Sue Thayer says that if the number of abortions got too low pressure was really put on the workers to get the number back up to an acceptable level It was on this big grid, and if we hit our goal, our line was green. If we were 5 percent under it was yellow, if we were 10 percent under it was red. Thats when we needed to have a corrective action plan  why we didnt hit the goal, what were going to do differently next time, she said.",1
"Title: Syria Archives  Article: Home  Posts tagged with  Syria (Page 6) British Government Approved The Sale of Chemicals That Syria Used to Make Nerve Gas It is now reported that 10 months after civil unrest in Syria began, England allowed at least one chemical firm to sell chemicals to Syria capable of being used to make nerve gas.

"Title: The mother of all jets  Article: This picture just screams ""Jet Age!"" A B-47 using rocket assist and water injection for takeoff. The origin of the B-47 actually goes back to 1943 when the Army put out a proposal for a jet powered bomber/reconnaissance aircraft. Jets were still in their very early stages in 1943 but the Army was looking a few years down the road. Boeings initial design used a conventional straight wing and would have looked a lot like a B-29 with jet engines. Except by then it was 1945 and we had discovered the German (of course) research on swept wings. Im actually surprised it took us until 1945 to figure this out. Wed already seen German ME-262s with swept wings that were 100 mph faster than anything we had. Boeing went back to the drawing board. No, really, they used drawing boards in those days. They redesigned their prototype to incorporate our knew aerodynamic knowledge. Now the tricky part, where do we stick the engines? The British liked to bury the engines in the wing root. This certainly made for a clean looking design. I think the De Havilland Comet is still one of the best looking jets ever built. It just looks right. The problems with burying the engines are three-fold. Maybe more than that but I can only think of three right now: 1. The wing has to be fairly thick to make room for the engines. 2. Its hard to get at the engines to work on them. 3. Thats not really where you want them to be if one catches on fire or goes explody. The Boeing engineers decided that slinging the engines on pylons under the wing was the way to go. This let them build a nice thin wing and made the engines much easier to get at.",0
"Title: America's Immigration Voice.  Article: Before the installation of Loretta Lynch as Attorney General, Senator Jeff Sessions (not for nothing called ""America's Senator"") said he wouldn't support her nomination because she supported the right of illegal aliens to work in this country. Sessions was right, but she was confirmed anyway. The day after a horrific shooting spree by what appears to be a radicalized Muslim man and his partner in San Bernardino, California, Attorney General Loretta Lynch pledged to a Muslim advocacy and lobbying group that she would take aggressive action against anyone who used ""anti-Muslim rhetoric"" that ""edges toward violence."" Speaking to the audience at the Muslim Advocates' 10th anniversary dinner Thursday, Lynch said her ""greatest fear"" is the ""incredibly disturbing rise of anti-Muslim rhetoric"" in America and vowed to prosecute any guilty of what she deemed violence-inspiring speech. Loretta Lynch Vows to Procecute Those Who use 'Anti-Muslim' Speech That 'Edges Toward Violence' By James Barrett, Daily Wire, December 4, 2015  Now we see that Attorney General Lynch is also a danger to freedom of speech. From the Daily Wire:Let that sink in. The ""greatest fear"" of the nation's chief law enforcement officer is not Islamic terrorism carried out against Americans. Instead, her ""greatest fear"" is ""anti-Muslim rhetoric"" in the United States. That's rather astonishing when you sit back and consider it. ""The fear that you have just mentioned is in fact my greatest fear as a prosecutor, as someone who is sworn to the protection of all of the American people, which is that the rhetoric will be accompanied by acts of violence,"" she said.",0
"Title: HALF of Americans Die Broke! Pension Funds are GONE!  Article: HALF of Americans Die Broke! Pension Funds are GONE! Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! Its not just the government which has found itself in unpayable amounts of debt. The people of the U.S. have been following suit. Looking around the world we see that most people encountering the same mess. Even cultures who typically dont use debt and mortgages, have expanded into these ways in recent years. Theres no turning back. Why are pensions disappearing? Wiatrowski points to risk. Private companies want to take on less risk when helping to provide for their employees retirement. Its why these companies are ever more frequently turning to defined contribution plans  such as 401(k) plans  in which employees typically fund most of their own retirement by automatically setting aside money from each paycheck. This differs from traditional defined benefit pension plans, in which employers promise to provide their workers a specific monthly payout once they retire. In a defined benefit pension plan, the risk of retirement funding falls on employers, Wiatrowski says. Employers must provide the benefits theyve promised employees no matter if the company is struggling or if its made poor investments. This isnt the case with defined contribution plans. In defined contribution plans, the risk falls to the employees, Wiatrowski says. The employer might match some or all of their employees savings, but they still know that each month or once a year theyll have to put in X amount of dollars. Their commitment is a fixed amount.",0
"Title: Rubio Sacrificed His Campaign to Save America  Article: Marco Rubios campaign ended yesterday. He wont acknowledge it and neither will his hardcore supporters for some days, but he is done. It was one thing when he was running more or less even with Cruz across the South, like he did on Super Tuesday, but Rubio has clearly lost his mojo, finishing behind Kasich in Maine and well behind Cruz in Kentucky and Louisiana. Rubio is running out of gas both metaphorically and physically. This is now a race between Cruz and Trump. I say this as a guy who a couple weeks ago endorse Rubio as the best chance to beat Trump. However, if I were Ted Cruz, I would be hoping that Marco Rubio does not drop out yet, at least not until after Thursday. Because the reason that Cruz was able to reach up and stun Donald Trump yesterday is that Rubio has picked apart Trumps vanity and caused him to self-immolate in a way that no candidate has been able to either before or since. Rubio was able to expose Trumps business record in a way that Cruz never was. Moreover, Rubios insult comic routine exposed what an ugly, shallow, insincere man Trump is to an electorate that was almost ready to embrace him as inevitable. Unfortunately, it also seems to have had the effect that it has destroyed Rubios chances at obtaining the nomination himself. Many voters who were horrified by Trumps response were equally horrified by Rubios behavior that provoked it.",0
"Title: Were From the International Community and Were Here to Help  Article: Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. I've always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the Government, and I'm here to help, Ronald Reagan famously said. But the most terrifying words in every other language are, Were from the international community and were here to help. In Haitian Creole that would be, ""Nou soti nan kominote entnasyonal la e nou isit la pou ede."" When an earthquake hit Haiti in 10, everyone who was anyone in the international community quickly showed up. Bill Clinton had been appointed as the UN Special Envoy for Haiti a year earlier where he had touted the unique opportunities for public and private investment in Haiti. The earthquake opened up those opportunities to Clinton Foundation donors. A year later, Bill Clinton was touting a $45 million new hotel owned by an Irish cell phone tycoon who was a close pal as the only thing a country with a million homeless needed. A CNN puff piece claimed that the hotel would house aid workers, potential investors and other visitors. Like Anderson Cooper, who needs someplace to take a hot shower after standing waist deep in water for 5 minutes on camera. Haiti was a gold mine for the Clintons. Literally. Hillarys brother was added to the board of a small company that got a gold mining permit at half the standard rates with a 25 year renewal option. Tony, Hillarys brother, is a college dropout who had worked as a repo man and a prison guard. The Clintons not only turned a disaster into a slush fund, but even got Hillarys idiot brother a gig.",0
"Title: Philippines: Cruise ship vanishes after reporting sea monster attack  Article: A cruise ship carrying 379 passengers and crew members is reported missing near the southern Philippine island of Mindanao after presumably being attacked by an unidentified sea creature. The Star of Manilla, an ocean liner belonging to Pacific Sunshine Cruises and carrying 255 passengers and 124 crew members, sent a distress signal and several radio messages around 2:30 AM this morning before suddenly disappearing. According to the Philippine Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Wilfredo Tamayo, the ship reported being attacked by a large snake-like creature. The crew reported being attacked by a creature twice as long as their ship. They begged for help, saying a gigantic snake was trying to sink the ship. Admiral Tamayo said that two BO-105C helicopters and a San Juan-class patrol vessel were immediately dispatched to the ships last known location, but found no sign of the ocean liner. The first helicopter arrived on the site less than an hour after the last radio message, but the ship had completely disappeared. Its almost impossible for a ship this size to sink this fast, something must have dragged it under.",0
"Title: Patrick J. Buchanan: Is Mayor de Blasio an Anti-Asian Bigot? | Articles  Article: Though New York City has one of the most segregated schoolsystems in the country, writes Elizabeth Harris of The New York Times, until now, Mayor Bill de Blasio ""was all but silent on the issue."" He was ""reluctant even to use the word 'segregation.'"" Now the notion that the liberal mayor belongs in the same basket as Southern governors in the '50s and '60s like Orval Faubus of Arkansas and Ross Barnett of Mississippi seems a bit of a stretch. For what Harris [Email her] means by ""segregation"" is that in the city's eight most prestigious schools, like Stuyvesant High School and the Bronx School of Science, where admission is by written test, the makeup of the student body does not remotely resemble the racial diversity of the city. ""Black and Hispanic students make up nearly 70 percent of the city's public school students,"" writes Harris, ""but they received just 10 percent of offers for seats at specialized schools this fall."" ""About 27 percent of the offers went to white students who make up 15 percent of the student system; 52 percent went to Asian students, who up make 16 percent."" Harris later adjusted her numbers. Asians are 62 percent of students. At Stuyvesant, only 10 of 900 students being admitted this fall are black. At Stuyvesant, The Wall Street Journal writes ""2.8% of students are Latino and 0.69% black. But 72.9% are Asian-American."" Harris decries this as ""extreme school segregation."" De Blasio now demands change: ""We must be sure that the very best high schools are open to ... every kind of New Yorker."" The student bodies at the elite public schools ""need to look like New York City.""",0
"Title: 2.8 Million Barrels Per Day: Activists Pull Off Huge Crude Oil Flow Shut-Down  Article: As a part of ongoing peaceful protests against the construction of new oil pipelines in the United States, protesters across four states halted the flow of crude from Canada by closing station valves. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has sued the US federal government to prevent construction of the 1,160-mile Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), claiming that tribal administration was not consulted, even though the pipeline runs through tribal lands. Thousands have rallied against the pipeline construction, and on Tuesday, protest group Climate Direct Action orchestrated a bold demonstration: cutting through fences surrounding remote flow stations in Washington, Montana, Minnesota, and North Dakota, activists shut down the southward flow of oil through multiple pipelines. ""We are acting in response to this catastrophe we are facing,"" said Afrin Sopariwala, a spokeswoman for the group. At least four individuals were arrested in relation to the stunt, which shut down pipelines belonging to Enbridge Inc., Spectra Energy, TransCanada, and Kinder Morgan.",0
"Title: Illinois Death Watch Continues...  Article: Authored by John Rubino via DollarCollapse.com, Its been a long time coming, but Illinois slow-mo financial disaster is now front page news. A few recent examples: IDOT has told contractors that all construction work is to shut down on June 30, according to a statement. Contractors will be advised to secure work zones to ensure their safety during any potential shutdown. Illinois has gone almost two full years without a state budget, which has hit education funding throughout the state and generated more than $14 billion in unpaid bills.14 Summer is both a high-volume construction season and a vaguely ominous time to cease road repairs; just last week, IDOT released a statement warning that the heat could lead to pavement buckling or blowing out. Without a budget in place, the state is not authorized to make payments to the association or Mega Millions. Lottery proceeds are about 2% of state revenue. Speaking of revenue corporate income tax collection is down 41.3%. Sales taxes are flat. How is this supposed to work? A financial crunch is spiraling into a serious problem for Illinois lawmakers, prompting some observers to wonder if the state might make history by becoming the first to go bankrupt. At the moment, its impossible for a state to file for bankruptcy protection, which is only afforded to counties and municipalities like Detroit. Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection could be extended to states if Congress took up the issue, although Stanford Law School professor Michael McConnell noted in an article last year that he believed the precedents are iffy for extending the option to states.",0
"Title: Islamists with Ties to Terror Lobby Congress  Article: For the past three years, Islamists with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and terrorist groups have come to Capitol Hill to lobby members of Congress on National Muslim Advocacy Day, an annual event organized by Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO). At last years lobby day, according to the Muslim Advocacy Day website, almost 400 participants visited congressional offices. I have now published a detailed report at the Middle East Forum that profiles the Islamist activists and officials involved with this lobbying effort, and who have previously met with members of Congress and their staffers. Some of these officials are directly linked to terrorists. Others have invited prominent Islamist extremists into American mosques: providing venues for them to spread their message of hate; funneling money to their networks; and using social media to publicize and encourage their activities. Some examples of these prominent terror-linked Islamist leaders who have participated in Muslim Advocacy Day include:  1. Oussama Jammal is the secretary general of US Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO), a coalition of American-Muslim organizations that hosts the Muslim Adovcacy Day. Jammal is also the director of the Muslim American Society - Public Affairs and Civic Engagement (MAS-PACE), a division of the Muslim American Society (MAS), which has been identified in court testimony as a front group for the Muslim Brotherhood. Jammal is also the vice president of the Mosque Foundation in Bridgeview.",1
"Title: Fred Phelps Deceased, Gay, Lesbian, and Transgendered Rights Activists Picket Funeral!  Article: Fred Phelps, founder of Westboro Baptist Church, died a few days ago. The bigoted, homophobic, and almost certainly closeted homosexual, died in Topeka Kansas. Phelps had been in a hospice, and had suffered from multiple still undisclosed severe illnesses toward the end of his life. Some sources report, that on his death bed, Fred Phelps recanted his ugly and bigoted views and embraced love, tolerance, and acceptance for all people. It is reported that a deathly-ill Phelps in the last few minutes of his life tearfully cried out and shouted Everyone is equal! Gays are just like you and me! Stop persecuting love! Stop that hating! If true, this recantation comes as far too little, far too late for most LGBT-Americans, who will forever remember the notorious Phelps as an intolerant hate-mongering funeral picketer! At a small private family service held in Topeka, several Gay, Lesbian and Transgendered rights activists with megaphones chanted, The homophobic hater is dead! and a few Gay and lesbian clergypersons chanted Fred Phelps, died and split hell wide open, burn in hell for homophobia Fred! Police were called out by the Phelps family, however they refused to disburse the protestors citing their first amendment right to protest the funeral. After the funeral service concluded, several homosexual men gathered around and on top of Phelps tombstone stomping on it repeatedly. Police then disbursed the protestors, although several individuals remained and shouted obscenities toward Phelps gravesite.",1
"Title: Pakistan Builds A Wall On Afghanistan Border To Control The Flow Of Terrorists  Article: In order to attempt to curtail the flow of terrorist between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the former country is building a wall on the border it shares with the latter. For the better security of our country and nation, we had to do this work, a Pakistani army official, Brig. Nisar. Nisar, who only uses one name, told journalists during a government-organized visit to the border that this is in Pakistans security interest. The barrier has angered the Afghan government, which disputes the location of the boundary and says the fence will tear communities apart. According to NBC News, construction began last year on two fences that parallel each other as they snake through the remote, mountainous landscape. Standing 13 feet high on the Afghan side and 11 feet on the Pakistani side, sharp spirals of silver barbed wire are cradled at the top of each. Additional coils of barbed wire have been placed on the ground in the gap between the fences, which are dotted with Pakistani military towers. Pakistans military says it will have 92 percent of the national border fenced before the end of 2019. Only three miles of the 789-mile stretch of the border along the remote southwestern province of Balochistan has been fenced so far, according to a military official who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity. However, there are some parts of the border will not be fenced as they are too mountainous. Many have questioned the efficacy of border walls, and whether or not the cost is worth the outcome. But if the goal is reducing an influx of human beings, there is at least some real-world evidence that border walls are effective.",0
"Title: Insurers Blame Trump For ObamaCare Premiums Skyrocketing  Article: Washington state and New York released projections Monday that revealed insurers in their individual markets are seeking to raise premiums dramatically. As Obamacare premiums continue to skyrocket, insurance companies are blaming president Donald Trump for the price hike citing the removal of the individual mandate. Theres still a great deal of uncertainty in individual markets across the country, fueled by the Trump administrations efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, Washington insurance commissioner Mike Kreidler said in a statement. Instead of getting behind solutions that shore up these markets, the administration seems solely focused on undermining our health insurance system and the individuals and families who need to buy their coverage in the individual market. Well, thats not exactly what removing the individual mandate did. Lets call a spade a spade, shall we? The individual mandate was a government dictate demanding that all Americans purchase health insurance that was the right kind of insurance as determined by the government. So because people are no longer forced to purchase their product at gunpoint or under threats of extortion, the insurance companies are throwing a fit and punishing those who still buy their product. Supporters of the individual mandates repeal cite the drastic increase in premiums that hit prior to repeal in making the case that the system was inefficient long before the Trump administration introduced greater uncertainty.",1
"Title: Patrick J. Buchanan: Trump's Historic Gamble In North Korea | Articles  Article: Earlier by Pat Buchanan: A Trump Doctrine for Singapore and Beyond  President Donald Trump appears to belong to what might be called the Benjamin Disraeli school of diplomacy. The British prime minister once counseled, ""Everyone likes flattery; and when you come to Royalty you should lay it on with a trowel."" At his Singapore summit, Trump smartly saluted a North Korean general and then lavished praise on Kim Jong Un as a ""strong guy"" with a ""good personality"" and a ""great negotiator."" ""He's funny, and ... very, very smart ... and a very strategic kind of a guy. ... His country does love him."" Predictably, Trump is being scourged for this. Yet, during his trip to Peking in 1972, Richard Nixon did not confront Chairman Mao on his history of massacres and murder, though Nixon's visit came in the midst of Mao's Cultural Revolution, a nationwide pogrom. Nor did Churchill or FDR at their wartime summits confront their ally Stalin for his legendary crimes against humanity. Both gushed over ""Uncle Joe."" Still, if the Trump-Kim camaraderie goes south and the crisis of 2017, when war seemed possible, returns, Trump, as he concedes, will be charged with naivety for having placed his trust in such a tyrant. Yet, to Trump's credit, we are surely at a better place than we were a year ago when Kim was testing hydrogen bombs and ICBMs, and he and Trump were trading threats and insults in what seemed the prelude to a new Korean War. Whatever one may think of his diplomacy, Trump has, for now, lifted the specter of nuclear war from the Korean peninsula and begun a negotiating process that could lead to tolerable coexistence.",0
"Title: Mitt Romneys Ohio Problem  Article: Weve all heard the axiom, as goes Ohio, so goes the nation. In fact, no Republican has ever won the Presidency without winning Ohio. And for this years GOP presidential primary, Ohio is the top prize in what is turning out to be a critical Super Tuesday on March 6th. In fact, just yesterday analyst Sean Trende of Real Clear Politics identified Ohio as the key state between a Romney runaway and the possibility of a brokered convention. So the viability of a three-way split probably comes down to Ohio, which has a fair number of evangelicals, though not to the degree that Tennessee, Oklahoma and Georgia do. Santorum has some strengths he can draw on in the Buckeye State, as his blue-collar message could play well even among Republicans there. If he wins, it means that we probably do have a deeply divided GOP, with Gingrich taking the anti-Romney vote in the South, and Santorum taking the anti-Romney vote in the Midwest. So with Ohio holding such incredible importance to Mitt Romneys hopes of becoming President, why is he betraying the very Ohio conservatives he needs to assure victory? Let me explain. As many of you may have read already, Ohio Republicans are currently in the midst of a major power struggle between moderate Ohio Republican Party Chairman Kevin DeWine and Governor John Kasich, Ohio House Speaker William Batchelder, and other conservative elected officials. Conservatives are up in arms against DeWine for a number of offenses, such as actively working against Governor Kasich in the mainstream media, by working to divert fundraisers away from Kasich near the end of his close battle against incumbent Gov.",0
"Title: MASSIVE SWING TO BREXIT FARAGE: UK, Italy to launch EU disintegration  InvestmentWatch  Article: EU Referendum: Poll reveals massive swing to Brexit  with just 12 days to go Exclusive: polling carried out for The Independent shows that 55 per cent of UK voters intend to vote for Britain to leave the EU in the 23 June referendum The campaign to take Britain out of the EU has opened up a remarkable 10-point lead over the Remain camp, according to an exclusive poll for The Independent. The survey of 2,000 people by ORB found that 55 per cent believe the UK should leave the EU (up four points since our last poll in April), while 45 per cent want it to remain (down four points). These figures are weighted to take account of peoples likelihood to vote. It is by far the biggest lead the Leave camp has enjoyed since ORB began polling the EU issue for The Independent a year ago, when it was Remain who enjoyed a 10-point lead. Now the tables have turned. Even when the findings are not weighted for turnout, Leave is on 53 per cent (up three points since April) and Remain on 47 per cent (down three). The online poll, taken on Wednesday and Thursday, suggests the Out camp has achieved momentum at the critical time ahead of the 23 June referendum.",0
"Title: UK Lord Asks If Mosques Will Be Monitored For Hate Speech - Gets Threatened With Hate Speech Prosecution For Asking  Article: A chronicle of a society in its death throes: Lord Pearson asks if Her Majestys Government whether, in pursuit of their anti-terrorism strategy, will require preaching in mosques and teaching in madrassas in England and Wales to be monitored for hate speech against non-Muslims. In response, the Muslim Baroness Warsi issues a warning: I shall be really careful how I phrase this with reference to the original Question. Could I ask Her Majestys Government whether, in pursuit of their antiterrorism strategy, they will require preaching in the form of Oral Questions and debate in your Lordships House to be monitored for hate speech and Islamophobia against Muslims? So the question of whether the government will monitor the mosques for hate speech is thrust aside, and Pearson is threatened for his Islamophobia. Everyone present except for Lord Pearson appears to assume that all the mosques in the UK teach peace and brotherhood, and that this should not be questioned.

"Title: Catholic schools legal battle continues over dismissal of former counselor, coach in gay marriage  Article: NewsCatholic Church, Homosexuality JERSEY CITY, New Jersey, December 21, 2016 (LifeSiteNews)  The discrimination lawsuit filed by a former New Jersey Catholic high school employee fired for entering into a homosexual marriage will move forward after a state appeals court declined review of a superior court decision allowing the suit to progress. Kate Drumgoole sued Paramus Catholic High School and the Archdiocese of Newark in April, claiming her dismissal last January violated the states anti-discrimination law and intentionally inflicted emotional distress. Drumgoole was fired as dean of guidance and head girls basketball coach after administrators learned she was married to another woman, which the school conceded in court last August, arguing it did not violate discrimination law because of the expectation for employees to abide by Catholic Church teaching. ""She was terminated for violating the Ministerial Policies and the Code of Ethics  in failing to abide by the tenets of the Roman Catholic faith, i.e. by entering into a same-sex marriage,"" the schools motion had said. Additionally, Drumgoole had signed an agreement more than once since she was hired to follow the Roman Catholic Churchs tenets, which was part of her collective bargaining contract. The superior court judge had ruled that further discovery was warranted, saying in particular the court must look at whether Drumgoole had worked in a ministerial capacity and therefore whether the dispute is secular or ecclesiastical.",0
"Title: ""Clinton Foundation Is Charity Fraud Of Epic Proportions"", Analyst Charges In Stunning Takedown  Article: In early May, we introduced readers to Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who uncovered financial discrepancies at General Electric before its stock crashed in 2008, and whom the Sunday Times of London described as ""one of the finest analysts of financial statements on the planet"" in a 2009 story detailing the troubles at AIG. Having moved on beyond simple corporate fraud, Ortel spent the past year and a half digging into something more relevant to the current US situation:""charities"", and specifically the Clinton Foundations public records, federal and state-level tax filings, and donor disclosures. Four months ago, Ortel began releasing his preliminary findings in the first of a series of up to 40 planned reports on his website. His allegation was simple: this is a charity fraud. To learn more about the Clinton Foundation, Ortel decided to ""take it apart and see how it worked"" and he has been doing that ever since February 2015. I decided, as I did with GE, lets pick one thats complicated, said Ortel. The Clinton Foundation is complicated, but its really very small compared to GE. When Ortel tried to match up the Clinton Foundations tax filings with the disclosure reports from its major donors, he said he started to find problems. That includes records from the foundations many offshootsincluding the Clinton Health Access Initiative and the Clinton Global Initiativeas well as its foreign subsidiaries. ""I decided it would be fun to cross-check what their donors thought they did when they donated to the Clinton Foundation, and thats when I got really irritated, he said.",1
"Title: After Being Kicked Off Show, Trump Supporting Pastor Tells Joy Reid To Move To Haiti %%  Article: Shortly after MSNBCs Joy Reid laid an epic smackdown on Trump supporting pastor Mark Burns and eventually kicked him off the show, Burns fled to the safety of his Twitter page to attack the cable news host. In the video, the pastor told Reid that she should move to Haiti since shes more concerned about Haitian immigrants than black Americans here in poverty. The full video: #AMJoy should moved to #Haiti since she cares more for Haitians than Black Americans here in Poverty https://t.co/xtcBTqyKI5  Pastor Mark Burns (@pastormarkburns) January 13, 2018 A portion of Burnss post-interview comments: Just wanted to say to Joy, who I consider a friend, shes always been very kind and I think fair to me, but I think obviously in the interview you just saw, if you watched Joy Reid, that she should just move to Haiti since shes more concerned about Haitian immigrants than black Americans here in poverty, in America. IF youre so concerned about the Haitians then you should move to Haiti and donate your checks to those families who are in need in Haiti. The offensive attack on Reid by Burns comes after Reid called him out for using religion to defend both Trumps racist shithole comment and his policy position that the United States should send Haitians back to their country. If the country is so broken, then how can you as a man of God justify sending people back to that country? Reid asked during the interview. Burns didnt have an adequate response and the interview unraveled from there, with the MSNBC host eventually ending the interview by telling the pastor, Youre wasting my time.",0
"Title: Fighting Islamophobia Across the Western World  Article: A specter is haunting the Western world  the specter of Islamophobia. Just ask the folks at the Institute for Social Policy & Understanding (ISPU). What is the ISPU, you ask? Why, it's an organization that is, in its own words, dedicated to creating a vibrant and truly pluralistic America, where Muslims are strong and equal participants. To this end, the ISPU conducts objective, solution-seeking research that empowers American Muslims to develop their community and fully contribute to democracy and pluralism in the United States. Founded in 2002  note the date  it has become a trusted source for information for and about American Muslims. When I glanced through the names of its directors and advisors, the name that jumped out at me was that of the not-exactly-trustworthy John Esposito, perhaps America's most infamous apologist for Islam. In his 1999 book The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality? again, note the date  he assured readers that they had nothing to fear from the Religion of Peace. Since 9/11, he has continued to whitewash everybody's favorite faith in such books as What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam (2002) and The Future of Islam (2010). Just out from the ISPU is its American Muslim Poll 2018: From Pride to Prejudice, which seeks to gauge American's attitude toward Islam and Muslims in the era of Donald Trump, and which is a product of a collaboration with the Bridge Initiative, a multi-year research project that connects the academic study of Islamophobia with the public square and thus spread awareness of Islamophobia as an obstacle to strong pluralistic societies and therefore a threat to human dignity and civil liberties.",0
"Title: 5 Transformative Rituals To Release 2015 & Welcome The New Year  Article: As the years end approaches, we find ourselves reflecting on everything that happened since the last one. How have we changed? Have we reached our goals? Are we where we want to be? They are heavy questions, but important to ask, because without checking in with ourselves, we cant possibly reach our ultimate potential; our ultimate happiness. But time and time again, many of us find there is still so much we havent crossed off our to-do lists. Whether it be to find a job that makes us feel enriched, speak to ourselves and others from a place of kindness, or pick up an exercise regimen we enjoy every single day, we let life get in the way of what matters to us most. Habits die hard, time takes over, and sometimes were left feeling really low by December 31st. So we set resolutions. We promise ourselves we wont do certain things, and that we will follow through with everything we failed to do last year. We prohibit in order to achieve greatness. But does practicing deprivation really work? Whether it be from drinking or judging, the more we tell ourselves no, the more we want it. And setting up your new year coming from a place of fear and negativity is no way to live. So how do we change our attitudes? First off, we must change how we view the New Year. When you are reflecting on how you would like to approach the end of the year, try viewing it as an opportunity to release the year and embrace the new one ahead. Next, try incorporating meaningful rituals to help you let go of 2015, regardless of what happened. Its time to make room for what lies ahead. 1.",0

A man who wishes to remain anonymous recently told End Times News Reports Jake Morphonios that there were multiple gunmen on the corner of Mandalay Bay Rd and Las Vegas Blvd at 9:50 p.m., ten minutes before the shooting officially started. The man told End Times News Report that he was up in the Delano hanging out with some friends on the night of October 1 when a female friend of his decided to grab an Uber and and go meet up with some other friends of hers at another location. She got picked up in an Uber down at the Delano valet, he said. She called me about five minutes later and I know the exact time she called because the timestamp is still on my cell phone  9:55 p.m.  she called me at 9:55 p.m.  As soon as I answered she tells me that there are shooters on the ground down in the street, he explained. Las Vegas Blvd was full of traffic so she hadnt made it very far away. The man said that the womans Uber ride had just turned onto the boulevard when she told him that she saw several gunmen. When she first called to tell me what she was seeing I thought she was joking but then I heard gunshots myself, the womans friend explained. It sounded like automatic gunfire.

"Title: Is It Kumbaya Or Is It The Calm Before The Storm?  Article: What is clear to even the most ill-informed citizen is that things are not good in Washington. While our Founding Fathers purposefully created a governmental structure of checks and balances, they didn't intend for it to be a government of inaction. Nor did they foresee a government composed of professional politicians who need to spend the bulk of their time raising funds and campaigning for reelection. Obviously, this reality impacts on the way in which members of congress react and act on any given issue. This is to say that often instead of acting in the interests of their constituents, they act in the interests of those who fund their campaigns, enabling them to successfully run for reelection. Certainly, this reality should come as no surprise to anyone who has been following this year's campaigns. What is also clear is that at times the interests of the political funders are at odds with the interests of the country and even the local constituents. This is obviously not surprising either. However, if we accept these two realities as fact, we acknowledge that we no longer have representative government. In fact, if only those who are funded by the rich, or those who have personal wealth can afford to run for office, we have moved to a plutocracy. It obviously gives incredible power to the likes of the Koch Brothers. It seems that this election, as others in the recent past, has illustrated the damage that money has done to our system of government. The Citizens United Supreme Court ruling and the unapologetic attitude of those who fund these elections has created a serious challenge to representative democracy.",0

"Title: Broward County Accepts Islamist Blood Money for School Shooting  Article: The Broward Education Foundation (BEF) has set up a fund to assist the survivors and the families of the victims of last months Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which took the lives of 17 innocent students and faculty. The fund has accepted money from many sources, including a group, the South Florida Muslim Federation, that acts as an umbrella organization for a number of smaller groups, many of which have numerous links to terrorism and bigotry. On March 5th, the Broward County Public Schools (BCPS) Superintendent Robert Runcie and BEF Executive Director Shea Ciriago held, up high, a check containing the South Florida Muslim Federation (SFMF) logo for $15,668. The money was raised via a page set up by SFMF on the crowdfunding site, LaunchGood. A dozen Muslim associates from the group came for the photo op and to present the check. A page on the SFMF website has been created to publicize the check presentation. On it are mentioned a number of SFMF groups that helped coordinate the raising of the funds. They include: the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA), the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), Islamic Relief (IR), and the Islamic Foundation of South Florida (IFSF). CAIR was established in June 1994 by operatives from Hamas, including then-global leader of Hamas, Mousa Abu Marzook. In 2007 and 2008, CAIR was named a co-conspirator by the US Justice Department for two federal trials dealing with the financing of millions of dollars to Hamas. CAIR had used its official website to raise money for the organization on trial, the Holy Land Foundation (HLF).",1
"Title: Teacher Questions Gun Control Walkout - Gets Put On Paid Leave  Article: A California teacher was placed on paid leave after she dared to question if pro-life students would be allowed to walkout of schools in the same manner the anti-Second Amendment students did earlier this week. Julianne Benzel, a teacher in Sacramento, California, was placed on paid leave after some viewed her questions as ""anti-abortion."" Diana Capra, the school district's chief of communications and community engagement, said in a statement: ""The teacher was not penalized or placed on leave based on her viewpoints. ...The district can clarify that the action was taken due to complaints from parents and students involving the teacher's communications regarding... the student-led remembrance activities."" Right, so, it appears that Breitbart's Senior Editor-at-large Joel Pollack was right. The schools are siding with political agendas. They are siding with parents and students who may support the murder of the unborn while trying to disarm the American people, but they cannot stand by their teacher for asking a simple question as to whether or not those students who support life can also perform the same type of protest as the anti-Second Amendment students. ""[If schools] are going to allow one group of students to get up during class and walk out to protest one issue, would they still give the same courtesy to another group of students who wanted to get up and walk out to protest? And I used the example of abortion,"" Benzel told ""Fox and Friends."" Benzel said that she had to take a ""mental health"" day after being asked to return to work on Friday.

"Title: Quebec Enjoying Mini-Baby Boom but is it Enough to Halt Demographic Decline?  Article: News By Hilary White MONTREAL, November 8, 2007 (LifeSiteNews.com)  After decades of suffering the lowest birth rate in North America, Quebec is enjoying a mini baby boom the Globe and Mail has reported. According to data from the provinces Institute de la Statistique, Quebec has seen an increase in the birth rate of 9 per cent between 2005 and 2006. This year, the statistics show almost 1,000 more births between April and June 2007, than in the same period last year. It is not the first time that such increases have been recorded, however, and Quebecs birth rate still remains well below replacement level. In 2001 a University of Toronto economist, Kevin Milligan, found that Quebecs birth rate rose during a nine-year baby bonus program that ended in 1997. He said the bonuses caused a 10 per cent increase in births by first-time mothers, 13 per cent for mothers who already had one child, and 25 per cent for those with two or more children. The program offered $500 for a first baby and up to $8,000 over five years for three or more births. But even with these increases, Quebecs birth rate in 1997 was one of the lowest in the world, at approximately 1.5 children per couple. Meanwhile, the number of abortions in Quebec doubled from 1980 to 2000. According to the most recent available statistics, Canadas overall fertility rate stands far below replacement level at 1.61 children born per woman. In 1998 the Institute de la Statistique showed 38 abortions per 100 live births in the province.",0
"Title: Celebrities To Leave US After Election of Racist, Sexist, Islamophobic, and Anti-Semitic Trump!  Article: By Ivan Fernando On November 8th everything changed. Americans voted to entirely repudiate the legacy of our first African-American President, Barack Hussein Obama, and to elect racist, sexist, bigoted, dangerous pathological narcissist Donald J. Trump, as President of the United States of America. My eyes are filled with tears as I write this and my heart is filled with sorrow. In times like this, I ask myself, is life worth living? Like so many progressives, I even contemplated throwing away my own life on that fateful night. Words cannot begin to express the pain, the hopelessness, and the fear, that progressives all around the world are feeling right now, as we tremble dreading the future. In response to this unacceptable outrage, progressives are demanding that this offensive election outcome be overturned in the name of preserving Americas Democracy! Of course, that is very unlikely to happen. Tragically, and inexplicably, Hillary Clinton has conceded the election to Trump, and President Obama has even invited the racist beast to the White House. Americans may think that they can vote for whoever they want, however they will pay a very serious price when they choose to vote for racist, sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic, and anti-Semitic candidates! A very serious price indeed, I assure you! A group of Americas most talented celebrities, including actors and musicians have joined together to form the Not Our Country Anymore Committee. Their purpose is to find an acceptable new country or countries for Americas most brilliant and talented celebrities. America has shown that it is a racist and backward country.",0
"Title: Italian Mayor: It's ""Beautiful"" To Be ""Invaded By Migrants""  Article: Yes, what could be more beautiful? What neither Leoluca Orlando nor anyone else will acknowledge is that Islam is a political and social system as well as a religion. All too many of the Muslim migrants are coming to Italy those who do have a ready-made model of society and governance that they consider superior to the Italian model, and are determined to replace the one with the other. This will not end well. French Media Pushing Pro-Migrant Narrative: Claims It is Beautiful To Be Invaded By Migrants, by Chris Tomlinson, Breitbart, January 12, 2018 (thanks to The Religion of Peace):  Sicily has borne much of the brunt of the large wave of migrants coming into Italy. But despite this, the mayor of Palermo has declared his love for migrants saying that the future of Italy is Google and Ali the immigrant. Mayor of Palermo Leoluca Orlando declared his love for newly arrived migrants from Africa, most of them coming into the country illegally claiming to be asylum seekers, in a largely pro-migrant article published by French centre-left newspaper Libration. If you ask me how many immigrants there are in Palermo, I do not answer 60, 70, or 80,000. Anyone who arrives in Palermo is a Palermo, Orlando said. The future has two names: Google and Ali the immigrant. Google expresses the virtual connection and Palermo is today the best wired and computerised city in the entire Mediterranean. Ali the migrant represents the human connection. We want to be a welcoming and modern city, he added. Around a million people have arrived in Italy in the last three years from Africa.",0
"Title: UN Millennium Development Goals Summit: 140 Heads of State and Government to Impose Eco-Communism of the Eco-Capitalists by Euro-Med  Article: This sure looks like something to investigate and put into proper perspective. Would you like to share yours, as we do? (It looks pervasively evil and threatening, so far. ) From Euro-Med.DK, Sunday, September 26 (line breaks added) Summary: 140 heads of state and government have met at the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set up in 2000 to implement 8 global development goals by 2015  including halving poverty. Despite many fine words, obviously not much has been achieved, because poverty, hunger, lack of information, education and womens suppression, for example are deeply rooted in thousand-year-old traditions, especially Islam and corruption, rather than in lack of money, and because the western nations have realized this and the UNs ineptitude. The UN will not attack the underlying causes. Rather the UN is pursuing a classical communist ideology, grapping [grabbing] our money through secret taxes. Financial transactions and the harmless CO2 are the means to pass our money on to the IMF and World Bank (who loves its saviour, Al Gore) and who retain a great deal to themselves and throw a few dollars to poor countries, who cannot be helped anyway, because they are unable or unwilling to help themselves.The pretext is to help saving human lives. But now information emanates from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights that the UN Security Council and the latest 2 UN secretaries-general have been privy to Paul Kagames genocide of 5.4 million Rwandans since 1990  without having intervened or informed the world about it.

"Title: The De Facto Agent of Influence  Article: The most recent claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin is running Donald Trump as if the U.S. president is a Russian intelligence asset comes from former Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James Clapper. [Putin] knows how to handle an asset, and thats what hes doing with the president, Clapper told CNN last Monday. Clapper, who served as DNI under President Barack Obama, and who has repeatedly disparaged Trump both before and since the 2016 election, called the Russian president a great case officer, which might be the only nice thing said about Putin by a former senior U.S. official in quite some time. Clapper was asked by CNNs Jim Sciutto, Youre saying that Russia is handling President Trump as an asset? He responded That seems to be thats the appearance to me. Later in the conversation, Clapper backtracked slightly, clarifying his remarks by adding Im saying this figuratively. It was not the first time that a former senior intelligence official rendered a judgment that Trump is an intelligence asset being exploited by the Russians. Back during the campaign, former Acting Director of the CIA Michael Morell wrote an op-ed for the New York Times entitled I Ran the CIA: Now Im Endorsing Hillary Clinton. Morell reasoned that Putin, a wily ex-career intelligence officer, is trained to identify vulnerabilities in an individual and to exploit them In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.",0
"Title: Trump to visit border wall prototypes in March  Article: WASHINGTON  President Donald Trump will travel to California next month on a cross-country trek that will include a visit to eight prototypes for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, a White House official confirmed Tuesday. The Washington Post first reported the news. The Trump administration has formally asked Congress for $18 billion in wall funding. The presidents immigration overhaul framework proposed a trust fund totaling $25 billion that would include the wall construction monies and be allotted in one lump sum  but as part of a broader immigration deal that has so far eluded lawmakers and the White House. With the Supreme Court on Monday opting against expediting a legal case about Trumps order to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that shields nearly 700,000 undocumented people from deportation, a March 5 deadline to pass a DACA-addressing immigration bill is now moot. That means Trumps proposed border wall project also now is in limbo  which puts fulfilling a major campaign pledge to his base in doubt as the midterm election season heats up. In his signature fashion, Trump on Friday told a conservative audience not to worry about whether he ultimately will get the border barrier built. Dont worry, youre getting the wall, he said at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington. Dont worry, OK? Were getting the wall. The audience, which he at time whipped into a frenzy during his wildly meandering remarks, responded with a chant that helped define his 2016 campaign: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!",1
"Title: Why The 2,776 NSA Violations Are No Big Deal  Article: Thanks to more documents leaked by Edward Snowden, this time to the Washington Post, we learned last week that a secret May 2012 internal audit by the NSA revealed 2,776 incidents of unauthorized collection of information on American citizens over the previous 12 months. They are routinely breaking their own rules and covering it up. The Post article quotes an NSA spokesman assuring the paper that the NSA attempts to identify such problems at the earliest possible moment. But what happened to all those communications intercepted improperly in the meantime? The answer is, they were logged and stored anyway. We also learned that the NSA routinely intercepts information from Americans while actually targeting foreigners, and that this is not even considered a violation. These intercepts are not deleted once discovered, even though they violate the governments own standards. As the article reports, once added to its databases, absent other restrictions, the communications of Americans may be searched freely. The Post article quotes an NSA official explaining that the thousands of unauthorized communications intercepts yearly are relatively insignificant. You can look at it as a percentage of our total activity that occurs each day.",0
"Title: Twitter crackdown on speech rapidly turning the platform into a mindless cesspool of conformist stupidity  Article: Twitter crackdown on speech rapidly turning the platform into a mindless cesspool of conformist stupidity Too many people are speaking their minds these days, and much of it is apparently too politically incorrect to allow on social media. This is the censorship position that Twitter is taking, anyway, as the 140-character message purveyor progressively unveils new Orwellian policies that aim to cull all forms of content that it determines to be hateful in nature. The changes, which concerned Twitter users are bringing to light using the hashtag #TwitterPurge, have already begun with the removal of obviously problematic content like non-consensual nudity and other forms of exploitative content. But the next phase of the purge, according to reports, is a lot less transparent, and could be used to target users who post anything that Twitters policy police determine to be offensive. As of this writing, the only information that Twitter has released about what it plans to remove next is that it will include Hateful Imagery and Hate Symbols. But what does this actually mean, and who gets to decide what constitutes a hateful image or symbol? So the only thing anyone who cares can do is wait until Twitter decides to provide further clarity as to the type of content it wishes to remove from its platform. Our media policy will be updated in the coming weeks to include hateful imagery and hate symbols, reads an obscure Twitter announcement about the upcoming new rules. This means that this content will no longer be permitted in avatars or profile headers. Tweets containing this type of content will be placed behind an interstitial.",0

"Title: The Trump Collusion Conspiracy Theory Falls Apart  Article: Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. Robert Mueller was appointed to investigate Russian collusion back in May. A new year is upon us. The warm May temperatures have been replaced by a deep freeze and snow is falling in Tallahassee. But after blowing through around $7 million and putting on an exciting show of surprise raids, gag orders, leaks and the varying pleas and indictments; Mueller still hasnt produced a single collusion indictment. Its much easier to pick Manaforts lock than to prove Hillary Clintons conspiracy theory. What Mueller did was harass a bunch of already shady characters into pleading guilty on minor charges, some, like lying to the FBI, created by his own investigation. All he had to do was get his team of Obama and Clinton supporters in front of Obama and Clinton judges who would rubber stamp anything. And the grand jury allegedly looked like a Bernie Sanders or Black Lives Matter rally with some participants wearing left-wing shirts. There wasnt a single white male among the 20 jurors. Thats a convenient way to screen out likely Trump supporters and bring in likely Trump opponents. Blatantly rigging it to a low bar is an admission by Mueller and his team that their case is too weak for prime time. Even now Manafort is suing the DOJ. His lawsuit may go nowhere, but the odds are good that Muellers tactics and evidence wont stand up to serious scrutiny.

"Title: Atrocity Porn and Hitler Memes  Article: American and global audiences have been bombarded with media images of wailing children in holding facilities, having been separated from adults (maybe their parents, maybe not) detained for illegal entry into the United States. The images have been accompanied by gut-wrenching audio of distraught toddlers screaming the Spanish equivalents of Mommy! and Daddy! since, as any parent knows, small children never cry or call for their parents except in the most horrifying, life-threatening circumstances. American and world media have provided helpful color commentary, condemning the caging of children as openly racist atrocities and state terrorism comparable to Nazi concentration camps and worse than FDRs internment of Japanese and Japanese-Americans. Indeed, just having voted for Trump is now reason enough for Americans to be labeled as Nazis. Finally, the presumptive Hitler himself, also known as President Donald Trump, citing the pleas of First Lady Melania and First Daughter Ivanka, signed an Executive Order to provide for adults and (their?) children to be detained together. However, the order is unlikely to hold up in court, with sanctuary-minded states aiming to obstruct border enforcement the way Trumps earlier order on vetting arrivals from terrorism-prone countries has been crippled by the federal judiciary. His media and bipartisan political opposition will be happy only when all border violation detentions cease and America has gone full Merkel, starting with ending Trumps declared zero tolerance for illegal crossings and restoration of Barack Obamas catch-and-release policy.",1
"Title: USA: Confederate Army General Revealed to Be a Woman  Article: Austin | George Edward Pickett, a Confederate Army General who played a major role in the last days of the Battle of Gettysburg, was in fact a woman. Newly disclosed information found in the last will of George Picketts father, Colonel Robert Pickett, proves without a doubt the confederate war general was a woman. The discovery was made at an auction in Austin, Texas, this week as american historian Graham Brown got his hands on the precious document. The will proves without a doubt the famous general who participated in the Battle of Gettysburg was in fact Mary Sue Pickett, his older sister. It also appears clearly evident that George Edward Pickett was never part of any military enterprise, but instead, that his sister was in fact the real man behind the legend. Mary Sue Pickett, who was George Picketts senior by one year, was also known to suffer from a rare genetic disorder known as hypertrichosis, a condition where an excess of androgen creates an hormonal unbalance that results in female beard growth. Official documents of the Pickett family released at the auction included documents confirming the death by tuberculosis of George Pickett at the tender age of 16. The death of the only boy of the family of eight possibly devastated his father, Colonel Robert Pickett, who dreamed of leaving a family military legacy behind him.

"Title: George Webb Was Setup  Suing The FBI (Andrew McCabe)  False Reports In CNN And NEW YORK TIMES And Other Publications Defamed Him  Asking Larry Klayman To Be His Attorney.  InvestmentWatch  Article: by Pamela Williams I knew this was going to happen sooner or later, and I hope Larry Klayman will take this lawsuit for George Webb and shoot to the moon with it. George Webb is an investigator and journalist I have been following for at least a year now. I trust him and the work he is doing. In the following video he explains much of what occurred to bring about this $$100M Defamation Lawsuit Versus Andrew McCabe of the FBI. George is also including other plaintiffs associated with his work and investigations in this lawsuit. Published on Jun 19, 2017 $$100M Defamation Lawsuit Versus Andrew McCabe. We Are All Plaintiffs I want to begin this complex report by listing the news outlets who printed this defaming story on George Webb. Not only did some print the story, they listed one of his videos from his website on YouTube. This is clearly evidence of defamation of the character of George Webb. He is asking Klayman to move forward as fast as he can, as his life is most likely in danger, as now he has been cast as a perp in this Charleston Port story. 1.http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/15/us/port-of-charleston-threat-evacuation/index.html A South Carolina port terminal was briefly evacuated because of a potential threat in a container ship, then reopened early Thursday after authorities scanned it and cleared it. It said the source of the original reporting source of the threat has been detained for questioning. Coast Guard Lt. JB Zorn said the threat was based on an anonymous claim shared by a man on YouTube. I want to comment here: George says he never called the Coast Guard, but they called him three times.",0
"Title: Trump Is Seeding War Clouds Over Iran  Article: https://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/trump-is-seeding-war-clouds-over-iran/  Trump and Pompeo are squeezing Iran where it hurts. They are trying to prevent Iran from selling oil internationally. They are applying maximum pressure upon Iran. This is overt. It is announced policy. For example, the State Department says  Very broadly, Saudi Arabia is a key partner in our effort to isolate and pressure Iran. And as I said, we had a number of bureaus from the State Department to discuss energy, diplomacy, security, and economic pressure. We were also joined by Treasury Under Secretary Sigal Mandelker for some of these meetings so that they can hear from Treasury officials and coordinate our efforts on applying maximum economic pressure on Iran. The U.S. is threatening China and India if they buy Iranian oil:  On Tuesday a senior State Department official described tightening the noose on Tehran as one of our top national security priorities. The official warned countries including China and India, who are key buyers of Iranian oil, that they should stop purchasing crude from the country before the November deadline or face US sanctions. Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally and enemy of Iran, will pump more oil to mitigate price effects of cutting Iran out of the international market. This increases enmity between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The economic isolation of Iran via an economic blockade deprives Iran of essential revenues. In essence, the U.S. policy is an act of war. Trump is seeding war clouds over Iran. He wants Iranians to overturn their government.",1
"Title: Minnesota Muslim Congressional Candidate Ilhan Omar Swore To Apparent Falsehoods In Court, While Divorcing Her Brother  Article: Despite this compelling evidence of dishonesty, Ilhan Omar will almost certainly be elected to Congress: voting against her would be Islamophobic. State Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) Swore to Apparent Falsehoods in Court  While Divorcing Her Alleged Brother, by David Steinberg, PJ Media, August 8, 2018:  Minnesota state Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-60B) is the presumed frontrunner for the MN-5 House seat being vacated by Rep. Keith Ellison (D). The seat is safely Democratic; Hollywood progressives, local party officials, and Minnesota media have all but scheduled the August 14 primary as her coronation. Their enthusiasm is rooted in Omars identity: she is a photogenic, hijab-wearing Muslim who entered the United States as a Somali child refugee. Likely because of this, however, Omars media and party supporters have been aggressively uninterested in a disturbing allegation about Omar with legal ramifications: that in 2009, she seems to have married her brother. That allegation has been public for nearly two years without Omar addressing its specific foundations. Newly uncovered evidence  exclusively published below  adds another allegation: Ilhan Omar has since signed off on apparent falsehoods, under penalty of perjury, during her 2017 divorce from the man in question: Ahmed Nur Said Elmi. take our poll - story continues below  Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

"Title: VDARE Radio: Phony Superpower Edition | Radio Vdare  Article: Welcome to Radio VDARE and Im your host Virginia Dare. Two stories today in quick succession. The top police officer in Afghanistan was killed, two Americans were wounded, and a top U.S. commander barely escaped in a terrorist attack earlier this week. [Top Afghan police chief killed, 2 Americans wounded in Kandahar attack, by Nick Paton Walsh, Barbara Starr and Ryan Browne, CNN, October 18, 2018] Some reports indicate that the killer was an Afghan bodyguard, meaning exactly the type of person whose job it is to prevent these kinds of attacks. Seventeen years after intervening in Afghanistan, we cant even assume a bodyguards loyalty to the countrys top officials. Meanwhile, a column of at least 7,000 migrants is heading towards our southern border. President Donald Trump is threatening to withhold aid to Latin American nations unless they do more to stop the migration. However, this presupposes that there is nothing we can do to stop them ourselves. [Trump threatens to cut aid to Honduras over migrants, BBC, October 17, 2018] Is this the behavior of a superpower, begging other nations to fulfill our basic responsibilities? After all, President Donald Trumps most iconic campaign promise was to build a wall on our southern bordera wall that we were told was going to be built quickly. Now nearing some tough midterm elections, no wall has been built. We were also told Mexico would pay for the wall. Even if Mexico does not give us wall money directly, we could still make the nations exporting their people to our country pay by slapping on a remittance tax. Yet for some reason, that idea has gone away. Why? Theres a fundamental premise underlying both of these stories.",1
"Title: Racists Use Wireless Networks To Propagate Hatred  Article: By Ray Charlston Racists around the world have discovered a new way of promoting hatred. Following the recommendations of Edward Thompson, an online blogger, racists have begun re-naming their wireless networks Race Realist or Race Realism in an attempt to intimidate minorities and spread their intolerant views. Authorities are currently investigating whether this action constitutes hate-speech, which is illegal in most of Europe but not in the US yet. For those who do not know, a wireless network refers to a computer network. In this case, one operating from an individuals home or business which provides wireless internet access for him or her, often for a family, or an office. For some time now, individuals have been able to select a name or designation of their choice for their wireless network. Computers in the vicinity of a wireless network will often automatically detect it, listing the name of a local network or networks. On his very offensive, racist, sexist, and homophobic blog, Edward Thompson states that his purpose is to Spread an awareness of Race Realism. He states that when a computer detects the wireless network, and people see the name Race Realist it may spike their curiosity or interest. They may do an internet search to find out more information. Its great free publicity that costs nothing more than ones existing internet service subscription. Thompson, while claiming that Race Realist is his favourite wireless network name, also suggests that racist individuals might alternate between names or vary them in order to reach neighbours or others in their vicinity with multiple offensive concepts.",1
"Title: There Has to Be Room for Dissent Among Obama Supporters %%  Article: Theres a true story in my husbands family passed along to teach everyone a valuable lesson. His grandfather was an eccentric man who loved to gamble, his game of choice being poker. One day, he placed an outlandish bet. He put up his house. As it happens, his bluff was called, and he lost his house. But it didnt really matter if he had won. He put something on the table that didnt belong in the game. Its not like a partial cut to Social Security proposed by the President is the equivalent to giving up your entire home. However, the moral of the story is that like the house, even if youre holding an excellent hand, some things dont belong in the game, because the stakes are too high. Everyone has their sacred cows, and for many who have watched Republicans throughout their entire lives try to find some foothold into dismantling Social Security, creating a precedent where this program could be cut was one of them. We have yet to see what will happen in the fiscal negotiations, but in the meantime, there are strained relationships among liberals outside the beltway. Some have seen fit to name call, label, and denigrate anyone who disagrees with the President. In a strong democracy, reasonable criticisms of the President or other elected officials have to be considered healthy and necessary, without stigma and condemnation raining down on those who make them. There are at least two ways to criticize a President. One way I will call bagging based on the language thats already been popularized. Bagging can be defined as relentless criticism of elected officials with a simultaneous inability to recognize any of their positive contributions.",0
"Title: Major Escalation: Israel Carries Out Large Scale Attack On Syria After Israeli F-16 Shot Down  Article: Update: According to Al Masdar, the Israeli pilot whose warplane was shot down by Syrian air defense forces on Saturday morning has died from injuries sustained during the engagement. While according to initial reports both crew members ejected  the weapons operator with light injuries and the pilot with severe injuries, according to subsequent, still unconfirmed, reports, the Israeli pilot with serious injuries has died in hospital. No further details were given according to Al Masdar. This report however is being denied by the Times of Israel which reported that the pilot suffered wounds to chest, abdomen while ejecting from jet; co-pilot set to be released home Sunday. The condition of the pilot, who was seriously injured after he was forced to evacuate the plane, stabilized Saturday morning, but he was still unconscious and connected to a respirator, doctors at Haifas Rambam Medical Center said. The condition of a seriously wounded Israeli pilot began to improve Saturday, after he underwent surgery for injuries he sustained while ejecting from his plane over northern Israel, in the midst of a severe confrontation between Israel, Syria, and Iran, the ToI reported. The F-16 jet he was piloting took part in Israeli airstrikes in response to an Iranian drone that entered Israeli airspace from Syria in the early morning hours on Saturday. | :          @OrHeller @alonbd pic.twitter.com/SjF0QWIpli    (@news10) February 10, 2018  As reported earlier (see below), a major battle broke out on Saturday between the Israeli Air Force and Syrian Air Defence Force over the occupied Golan Region, south Lebanon and the west Damascus region.",1
"Title: Anti-American Leftists Set To Expose Themselves At President Trump's First State Of The Union Speech  Article: The NWO neo-Nazi Left in Washington just cannot help themselves in identifying who they really are. During president Trump's first State of the Union speech in 2018, they will be showing us who the real anti-Americans are by either not showing up in protest, or by wearing black. The usual known psychos like Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, Al Green, John McCain, Frederica Wilson, John Lewis, Jeff Flake, and the list goes on, will either not be attending the SOTU or be wearing black. As many as 40 lawmakers have said they will not be attending the event at all. The benefit to American Patriots who believe in the sovereignty of the United States and the constitution as the basis of all law in the country, will be knowing who the people in office are who are busy trying to destroy their country. The usual protests against president Trump have already been arranged by some of these lawmakers to take place outside during the speech, which tells us basically that most of these lawmakers who are protesting against the President are either very close or actual members of the known terrorist groups BLM and ANTIFA. The DNC passed a resolution in 2015 supporting BLM and Hillary Clinton has funneled millions to BLM via various transactions from the Clinton Foundation. Since both BLM and ANTIFA have been labeled as terrorist organizations by the FBI and DHS, anyone who donates money to either of them is committing an act of treason against the US and should be arrested. The group BLM was the brainchild of Barack H Obama, thus it comes as no surprise that the Clinton's and most of the anti-American Left support it and or actually belong to it.",1
"Title: The Republican Plan To Bail On The Presidential Debates Has Completely Backfired %%  Article: RNC Chairman Reince Priebus was trying to use the planned Hillary Clinton programs on CNN and NBC as an excuse to cut down on the number of 2016 debates. Instead, his plan has completely backfired. Chairman Priebus sent letters to CNN and NBC demanding that they cancel respectively a documentary and a mini-series about Hillary Clinton. Priebus threatened that if these programs were not canceled, there would be no Republican primary debates on CNN and NBC. Here is the RNC letter to CNN: GOPCNN Priebus had three goals when he sent the letter. He is already trying to build in an excuse for Republicans losing the 2016 election. (The media was in the bag for Hillary.) Priebus was trying to motivate the Republican base with cries of liberal media bias, and most importantly, he was looking for an excuse to cancel Republican primary debates. The head of the RNC is convinced that Republicans lost because they reached too many voters. Part of his big plan to remake the GOP after their 2012 defeat is to build up a front runner and wrap up the nomination early by limiting the number of primary debates. Priebus recently admitted to Fox News that his party cant handle the scrutiny of the primary process: On Fox News, Priebus lashed out at the number of debates and moderators, I think 23 debates is ridiculous, but the second thing that is ridiculous is allowing moderators, who are not serving the best interests of the candidate and the party, to actually be the people to be deposing our people.",0
"Title: Washington and Allies Go Orwellian  Article: Just as North and South Korea achieve important peaceful exchanges, Washington and its NATO allies appear to be moving with determination to sabotage the initiative for averting war on the East Asian peninsula. Further, the reckless, gratuitous provocations beg the conclusion that the United States is indeed trying to start a war. Meanwhile, unprecedented accusations this week by US President Donald Trump that Russia is supporting North Korea to evade United Nations sanctions also point to the danger that any conflict could spiral out of control to engulf world nuclear powers. Moscow rejected the unsubstantiated claims leveled by Trump, saying that Russia is abiding by UN trade restrictions over North Korea, and that the American presidents allegations were entirely unfounded. Trumps verbal broadside suggests that Washington is trying to undermine the nascent talks between the two Koreas, talks which Russia and China have both applauded as a long-overdue diplomatic effort to resolve the Korean conflict. Separately, Russias Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov deplored a summit held in Vancouver, Canada, earlier this week in which the US and 19 other nations  most of them NATO members  called for sharper sanctions on North Korea that go beyond the remit of the United Nations. The conference, co-hosted by Canadas Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, issued a stridently bellicose statement, calling in effect for North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons or face US-led military action. Significantly, and pointedly, China and Russia were not invited to the Canadian summit.",1
"Title: It's Time For An Adult Conversation  Article: It's Time For An Adult Conversation (Before It's News) By February 2011, now just over four months away, America will know whether the Republican Party that they have returned to power in the House, along with the increased number in the Senate, truly are a new breed of Republicans (or rather, a return to the traditional Republicans of the pasttrue limited government, low tax conservatives), or whether we have the same mess as before in new packaging. To be sure, Republicans are unlikely to accomplish much in 2011 and 2012, at least from an administrative standpoint. Even if they regain a majority in the House (very likely) and Senate (an outside possibility requiring all the stars to align), they are still faced with an opposition president wielding veto power, a president who has vowed that there will be hand-to-hand combat in Washington if Republicans win. Despite his lofty rhetoric of ushering in an era of true bipartisanship, Obamas latest comments reveal what most of us already knew. Namely, that bipartisanship to Democrats means Republicans must vote for everything that the Democrat majority passes or be labeled as obstructionist. This is the same president who, shortly after taking office in January 2009, and when facing Republican opposition to the stimulus package, repeatedly reminded Republicans that hed won the election. Therefore, the implication being, America has accepted his goals and his agenda and there will be no compromises.",1
"Title: NRA Freaks Out After Obama Moves To Keep Guns Out of the Hands of Convicted Felons  Article: As expected, the National Rifle Association freaked out today after the Obama administration announced that they are going to keep the most dangerous firearms out of the wrong hands and ban almost all re-imports of military surplus firearms to private entities. Requiring background checks for corporations and trusts does not keep firearms out of the hands of criminals, NRA spokesperson Andrew Arulanandam said in a statement released on Buzzfeed. Prohibiting the re-importation of firearms into the U.S. that were manufactured 50 or more years ago does not keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. He huffed and he puffed, This administration should get serious about prosecuting violent criminals who misuse guns and stop focusing its efforts on law-abiding gun owners. (Continued Below) Yeah, wow. Sure sounds like Obama is tyrant of the highest order. Obama is taking aim at law-abiding gun owners  if by law-abiding gun owners you mean convicted felons and domestic abusers, which may be the same thing in Republican world. The ATF rule would require those who register a gun to a corporation to undergo a background check, thereby closing a loophole that permits convicted felons, domestic abusers and others who are not supposed to own guns to buy them. This loophole rule applies to convicted felons and domestic abusers.",0
"Title: Farrakhan, Bari Weiss, Anti-Semitism and the Progressive Media  Article: There are two hot trends in the progressive media now. 1. Excusing Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam  2. Attacking Bari Weiss, a Jewish liberal New York Times columnist who called out anti-Semitism on the left, especially in the Women's March, whose leaders have praised Farrakhan  The two trends are one and the same. The same progressive media echo chamber is fighting to protect an anti-Semitic intersectional movement while attacking a Jewish woman who called it out. Examples of the former trend include, Why Tamika Mallory Wont Condemn Farrakhan at The Atlantic, Shaun King at The Intercept, ""A Word About Louis Farrakhan and Tamika Mallory"" at The Root, and Masha Gessen at the New Yorker. Some examples of the latter include the Neo-Soviet titled rant, ""A New York Times columnist blamed a far-left 'mob' for her woes. But maybe she deserves them"" by Avi Selk at the Washington Post, Ben Mathis-Lilley at Slate, an attack from Glenn Greenwald, the Hamas apologist at the top of The Intercept and the Bari Weiss Problem at The Outline. The former are filled with special pleading and the latter furious intolerance. We are expected to make special allowances for Farrakhan's black leftist fans while rabidly hating a Jewish woman whose real crime was challenging the leftist comfort level with anti-Semitism. Little more needs to be said. It's tediously predictable that the loudest attacks on Bari Weiss come from lefty columnists with Jewish last names. It's far safer to attack Bari Weiss than it is to stand up to Farrakhan.",0

"Title: SYRIA: The White Helmets, Their Backers and Their Many Shades of Grey  Article: By Jan Oberg Transnational Foundation for Peace & Future Research While thousands of humanitarian organisations around the world are struggling fiercely with diminishing support from governments and the public, one has achieved a surprising amount of support from Western governments in a surprisingly short period of time and gained a surprising attention from mainstream media and ditto political elites: The Syrian Civil Defence or White Helmets. Their name of course makes you think of the UNs Blue Helmet and white is the colour of those who should be protected in harms way  and the colour of innocence. However, for many years there has been an Argentinian relief organisation with the same name. The SCD or White Helmets counts nearly 3.000 rescue workers who operate in very dangerous areas in rebel-held territories in Syria and claims that it has, in three years, rescued about 70.000 lives according to its Twitter account (or 65 per day). Contrary to what you might think, it isnt a Syrian organisation because Syria has its own organisation, incidentally also called Syria Civil Defence, which was established in 1953 and is registered with ICDO, the International Civil Defence Organisation, since 1972. The White Helmets seems to have an annual budget of US$$ 30 million and has raised a total support of well over US$$ 100 million. And it seems that they operate exclusively in war zones in which the fighting against the Syrian government and the Syrian Arab Army takes place, i.e.",0
"Title: Bigger than Jesus? How Rock and Roll and the Beatles Supplanted Christianity and Destroyed the West  Article: And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. - Mark 3:25  Over at First Things, one of the last redoubts of Catholic neoconservativism, John Waters has a curious article, How U2 betrayed Rock and Roll, arguing that the Irish quartet of aging rockers recent support of the yes vote in the Irish referendum on abortion is the unfortunate culmination of the bands spiritual and musical degeneration throughout the 90s and 2000s. However, Waters critique is followed by an odd affirmation that the Dubliner rockers, who had identified with Christianity off and on in their careers, were once a sincere and thoughtful group, concerned with the noble task of truth-telling. In fact, Waters even argues further that rock and roll is at least rooted in the authentic, nay even Christian spirituality of the singing of black slaves in the antebellum American Southalthough Waters does admit that the relationship between Christ and rock n roll is paradoxical at best. While Waters is correct in his deserved praise of the aesthetic quality of U2s music, he errs in his assessment of rock and rolls allegedly noble roots. Despite obvious precedence in Gospel-infused songs sung by slaves as well as in European ballads possibly dating back to the Paleolithic period, rock and roll has always been evil. At risk of reviving the Satanic Panic of the 1980s, it must be noted that there is no more relation between Christ and rock and roll than there is between Christ and Satan.",0
"Title: Why Wright Matters: Obamas on a Mission from God  Article: Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! A REPUBLIC, IF YOU CAN KEEP IT. ~BENJAMIN FRANKLIN By Tom Rowan | May 20, 2012 | American Thinker When Elwood retrieved his brother Jake from Joliet prison, the two went on a pilgrimage to their childhood Catholic orphanage. Their pitiful orphanage was under siege from Chicagos infamously oppressive tax regime and was being put out of business. For inspiration, the brothers were directed to a Chicago Baptist church. The church was filled with laughter and love, song and dance, and miraculous divine inspiration that set the Blues Brothers on their own mission with a purpose: keep hope alive for Chicago orphans by paying off the corrupt Chicago regime. The movie rendition of an all-black Baptist church led by the charismatic James Brown preacher, thrilling his flock with high-spirited love and devotion, is what gave The Blues Brothers soul. This was what America imagined successful, loving black churches in Chicago looked like. No wonder, then, that Reverend Wrights scream for God to damn America is so jarring even to this day. Reverend Wrights sentiment and his rants do not belong in any American church. Getting people high on hating America and its so-called white oppressors is what carnival barkers like Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson do for a living. Most Americans still find it hard to reconcile the rage and the hate being preached at our presidents old house of worship. Christians get high on love, not hate. Christians are encouraged to be forgiving, not condemning. Christians seek to spread the good news and Christs commandment that [y]ou shall love your neighbor as yourself.",1

We experience two quite different offerings at Travelodge, Sampford Peverell Service Area, Sampford Peverell, M5 (Junction 27), near Tiverton and at The Barn and Pinn Cottage, near Sidmouth. The Travelodge is up to 40 minutes away from the Regency seaside town. Visitors to this hotel know what to expect; the basics: a bed and en-suite accommodationnothing fancy. There is no restaurant at this particular Travelodge although cereal and juice can be purchased for breakfast for 5.25 per person. Theres also free car parking. We stay in a family room because our son Henry (18 months) is accompanying us and so there is room for his travel cot. But I notice that there is a pull out bed underneath the double bed as well as another bed in the corner of the room, so it would be possible for our family of five to stay, if necessary. Theres a double bed and en-suite bathroom. The staff are helpful and friendly and even though it is quite close to the motorway it is not even a distant rumble away thanks to good double glazing. Whenever we stay in a Travelodge they are always popular and this is no different, a variety of guests ranging from trades people to business people. The highlight of our stay is the fact that there is actually a bath. Most travellers may not bat an eyelid at this but since moving to our new home which currently only has a shower room, we miss our bath.

"Title: John Oliver: The Confederate Flag Helps Us Identify the Worst People in the World %%  Article: John Oliver called it out on Last Week Tonight, saying that the Confederate flag is one of those symbols that should only be used to help us identify the worst people in the world. Watch the clip from Sundays show here: While the American flag was flying at half-staff on the South Carolina capitol building after the terrorist attack that killed nine people in a place of worship, Oliver explained, The one thing especially appalling  the Confederate battle flag was flying at full staff in front of the state capitol. The bigger question is why is it flying at any staff at all. In for the truth shot, Oliver added, The Confederate flag is one of those symbols that should really only be seen on T-shirts, belt buckles, and bumper stickers to help the rest of us identify the worst people in the world. If youre not from the south or havent lived there for a long time, the clip of South Carolina Senator and Republican presidential candidate Lindsey Graham explaining that the Confederate flag is who we are might shock you. Graham begrudgingly admitted  in that southern drawl that says this is ugly, and we shouldnt talk about it  that the flag has sometimes been used in a racist way. Sometimes, yall. Oliver wasnt having any of that, and he pointed out, I believe the first time the Confederate flag was used in a racist way was the exact second they finished sewing the first one! It was around that time! But really, this is the point. This is what people need to realize, especially in light of the Supreme Court saying that we dont need voter protection in the South anymore. The South glorifies that flag. If youre not from the south, you dont understand. This is who we are.",1

Up until that point I will support and donate to Bernie Sanders. I see no point in attacking Hillary Clinton, as giving the right more drool fuel than they already have is just plain nuts. If Clinton wins the primary the hate, misogyny and toxicity on show will be truly appalling. Hell I'm not even a Democrat [never will be either] but it has been a fact that for at least the last 60 years that the Republicans make handling plutonium safe by comparison. Also I really don't like the bipartisan center as that operates for one group of people alone, the extremely wealthy and coddles within it the warmongers. I don't like the two party first past the post system, but are we going to change that anytime soon? I don't like the corruption and favors linked to how campaigns are financed, it distorts further an already distorted system. Personally I can live with President Obama's policies and by the same logic Hillary Clinton's. I may not like the policies, I may disagree loudly and in my opinion they are too easily dragged to right of the great divide, but to even think of allowing another Republican jackass into the White House just makes me want to vomit. I have said for a long time that if you want to change the Democratic Party you have to do it from the ground up. That is one of the reasons I support Bernie Sanders 100% as to me this is a sign of a shift in the debate. Elizabeth Warren another.

"Title: Pope Francis Invites The Homeless, Undocumented Immigrants And Prostitutes To Exclusive Catered Vatican Banquet  Article: By Werombi Towradji Pope Francis is no stranger to controversy, having been a frequent target for criticism by the radical and extreme right. His Holiness, the Bishop of Rome and Vicar of Christ, recently held a banquet at the Vatican. It was unlike any in the entire history of the Roman Catholic Church. Unlike other elite Vatican events, this one had a very unusual guest list, including prostitutes, drug addicts, unwed mothers, undocumented migrants and the homeless. Pope Francis defended the banquet, citing Matthew 9:11-13 from the Bible. The verses read: And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples: Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners? But Jesus hearing it, said: They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill. Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I am not come to call the just, but sinners. It is time for the church to enter the real world. We must recognize that real people are complex. No one is perfect, least of all me Pope Francis observed. Referring to himself as the Chief of sinners, Pope Francis said We have all sinned. It is not my job to judge anyone, it is only to share Gods boundless and infinite love. You cannot claim to truly love another if you also judge them at the same time. Do not forget Matthew 7:1-3. As pope, I have a special responsibility to seek after those souls that are most in need of my help. Shall I with one hand draw the person near and with the other push them away? This is hypocritical, it is not sincere.",0
"Title: Millionaire Poverty Pimps Fight 'Income Inequality'  Article: Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. Bernie Sanders, Michael Moore and Elizabeth Warren, three lefty millionaires, got together to solve ""income inequality"" in a town hall broadcast live from the Capitol visitors center. Washington D.C., where two out of the three parasites do business, has the worst income inequality in the country. The bottom fifth of Washington D.C. account for just 2% of the citys income. It has one of the highest poverty rates in the country and the highest food stamp use. And under Obama, the Imperial City of the politicians and the poor was surrounded by some of the wealthiest districts in the country. Income Inequality in America: The Rise of Oligarchy and Collapse of the Middle Class, the Sanders, Warren and Moore town hall, comes to progs from the most unequal and oligarchic city in America  If Bernie, Liz and Michael really want to see income inequality, they can take a walk away from the marble and glass edifices of big government to see what big government had wrought. It isnt any of their usual villains, the corporations and banks, who made Washington D.C. so miserable. Its the triumph of socialism. Washington D.C. and its bedroom communities are what the entire country would look like if the left got its way. A socialist apartheid state divided between the business of government and the poor. But the three socialist stooges arent just in the business of politics. Theyre millionaire poverty pimps. Bernie Sanders made over $1 million pushing conspiracy theories about income inequality.",1
"Title: America is F___ Racist, Men are Garbage, #CancelWhitePeople: New York Times Hire  Article: While some in the ""conservative"" media are defending racist New York Times writer Sarah Jeong, Robert Stacy McCain notes that she isn't just a racist, but has a history of ugly views toward various groups. She responded to the 2014 race riot in Ferguson, Missouri, by aiming obscenities at the police and declaring America is fking racist. This rhetoric was not a response to harassment, nor was Ms. Jeong mimicking anyone as satire. Her anti-police sentiments, like her anti-Christian sentiments, are evidently sincere... In July 2014, she tweeted a question: hey whats worse, a man who calls himself a feminist, or a man who refuses to call himself a feminist? To which she answered: its a trick question all men are equally garbage in my eyes. She has declared men are innately, unintentionally garbage (Feb. 24, 2015) and men are fountains of meaningless garbage and they see every woman as an open landfill for their thoughts (April 22, 2015)... A minute later, she added another tweet: Being a straight woman is like being attracted to garbage heaps made of radioactive arsenic. McCain specifically attacks the excuse, given by the Times and Jeong that this was just trolling. (The excuse never passed muster for the alt-right, I don't see why it should for the alt-left.) This was not counter-trolling or satire, this was the declaration of a committed feminist ideologue, and her various anti-white comments (e.g., Dumbass fking white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs psing on fire hydrants) are entirely consistent with her general worldview. And Andrew Sullivan, of all people, calls this out for the garbage excuse that it is.",1
"Title: Rasmussen Poll: Trump's Approval Rating Among Black Voters Now 29% vs. 15% One Year Ago  Article: New Rasmussen poll results point to an increase in President Trump's approval among black voters to 29% from 15% one year ago. And it would not take a huge shift in black voter sentiment to sway an election. If the results of this poll, a near doubling of support in one year, are genuine and sustainable, Democrats have reason to worry. Although this news may sound surprising, there are valid reasons for blacks to gravitate toward Trump. Democratic candidates generally take black support for granted, but Trump has actually made an effort to reach out to the black community. #ICYMI: From yesterday: Todays @realDonaldTrump approval ratings among black voters: 29% take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

"Title: Erdogan to US: Get out of the way so we can kill Kurds  Article: Over the weekend, the killing began in earnest. Turkey used its U.S.-supplied fighter jets to bomb more than one hundred targets in the predominantly Kurdish province of Afrin in Northern Syria on Saturday, killing civilians and YPG fighters alike. On Sunday, Turkish ground troops crossed the border, invading Syria. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has made his intentions abundantly clear, vowing repeatedly to crush the Kurdish-led democratic government in Afrin, on Turkeys southern border. But it was Erdogans threats last week to U.S. troops serving as advisors to Kurdish fighters in northern Syria that were the real show stopper. ""This is what we have to say to all our allies: don't get in between us and terrorist organizations, or we will not be responsible for the unwanted consequences,"" Erdogan said in a speech in Ankara. ""Either you take off your flags on those terrorist organizations, or we will have to hand those flags over to you, Don't force us to bury in the ground those who are with terrorists,"" he said. In other words, Get out of the way, or you die. Erdogan was ostensibly responding to a statement from a U.S. military spokesman a few days earlier, who revealed that the U.S. was working with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to establish and train the new Syrian Border Security Force. The inaugural class of the new border security force, currently in training, was just 230 persons. But the goal was a final force size of approximately 30,000, the spokesman said. When he heard that, Erdogan went ballistic, absolutely insane.",0
"Title: Were Off to a Good Start!  Article: President Donald Trump described his much anticipated meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin as off to a good start, after meeting one-on-one with Putin for over two hours on Monday. Trump made his remarks to reporters before the start of a working lunch with Putin and his aides, which followed the two leaders private session. Before meeting with Putin, Trump said that the US and Russia will end up having an extraordinary relationship, despite current difficulties, adding I think the world wants to see us get along. Before his private discussion with Putin, Trump told reporters that he intended to discuss everything from trade to military to missiles to nuclear to China. Before the summit, Trump blamed previous administrations for the deterioration in relations between the US and Russia, tweeting: Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt! a reference to the ongoing and thus far unsuccessful Mueller investigation. The meeting took place amid opposition from both Democrats and Republicans at home. White House Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian hackers on Friday, and the news was expected to cast a cloud over the summit, despite the fact that the hackers alleged offences took place during the Obama administration.

"Title: Why One Doctor Believes A Killer Flu Pandemic Is Just Around The Corner  Article: Dr. Jonathan Quick, a medical doctor and one of the worlds top health professionals claims that the conditions are perfect for a new superbug in the form of a killer flu virus pandemic. Quick also believes that this pandemic could kill upwards of 33 million people in just 200 days. A piece written by Dr. Quick and published on The Daily Mail UKs website lays out why the doctor believes this pandemic is just around the corner. The big one is coming: a global virus pandemic that could kill 33 million victims in its first 200 days. Within the ensuing two years, more than 300 million people could perish worldwide. Dr. Jonathan Quick, The Daily Mail UK  Quick says one extreme scenario of a killer flu pandemic will fling the globe into financial chaos. If millions of people die because of the pandemic, there wont be enough survivors to run the computers or energy systems, leaving many to loot or die of starvation in the months following such a deadly outbreak. As a medical doctor and a health chief who has led global programmes at the World Health Organisation (WHO), I believe that the world is at risk of a viral pandemic that will be at least as deadly as anything we have ever known before. The most likely culprit will be a new and unprecedentedly deadly mutation of the influenza virus. The conditions are right. It could happen tomorrow. Dr. Jonathan Quick, The Daily Mail UK  A century after the Spanish Influenza outbreak which killed 100 million people, we are just as vulnerable to the flu now, says Dr. Qucik. But what about all those fancy vaccines? Doesnt that mean they dont work? Logic says yes but propaganda says no.",0
"Title: Communists and Socialists Embedded In Our Government!  Article: Has anyone ever wondered if we had Communists and Socialists working within our government to destroy our nation? We have found in plain sight many people with deep connections to both of these groups working within our Congress making laws that may well lead to becoming either a Socialist or Communist state. Let us begin with the Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Rep. Nancy Pelosi. Now, people will say this is crazy but if you dig deep enough you will see what we lay claim to here, but this is just the beginning as we will also show others with the same type of ideas and ones that are seen regularly. Nancy Pelosi (See-http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=1248)  On November 11 1995, Pelosi and fellow Democratic Congressman Ron Dellums were the keynote speakers at a public hearing on jobs and economic insecurity in San Francisco. The event was co-sponsored by the San Francisco Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and the Full Employment Coalition. In the 1996 Congressional elections, the DSA's Political Action Committee endorsed Pelosi's candidacy. I pride myself in being called a liberal, Pelosi said that year. ... I dont consider myself a moderate. [7] In 1997 Pelosi co-sponsored Congressman Matthew Martinez's Job Creation and Infrastructure Restoration Act, which proposed to use $250 billion in federal funds for the establishment of union-wage jobs rebuilding infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, libraries, public transportation, highways, and parks).",1
"Title: Dutch Study Shows Patients Requesting Euthanasia Likely Depressed  Article: News By Hilary White LEIDEN, January 16, 2006 (LifeSiteNews.com)  A study published by Dutch researchers in the September 20, 2005 edition of the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) has shown that at least 50% of patients killed under the Dutch euthanasia programme were suffering from depression. In addition, 44% of those suffering from cancer showed clinical signs of depression when they asked for euthanasia. Titled, Euthanasia and Depression: A Prospective Cohort Study Among TerminallyIll Cancer Patients, the study reports that the risk to request euthanasia for patients with depressed mood was 4 times higher than that of patients without a depressed mood. The significance of the study is sharpened since the researchers themselves admitted to a strong bias against their own findings. The researchers at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands, wrote that they were uncomfortable with the idea that a request for euthanasia is a symptom of depression and that the patients request for suicide should be deferred until his depression was treated. The authors bias in favour of the Dutch euthanasia doctrine is clear: The patients wish to hasten death cannot be put on par with a well-considered and persistent request for euthanasia in an environment where euthanasia is customary. Our clinical impression was that such requests were well considered decisions, thoroughly discussed with healthcare workers and family. We thought the patients requesting euthanasia were more accepting their impending death and we therefore expected them to be less depressed.",0
"Title: Trump: ""I'd Love to See a Shutdown""  Article: So, here we are again, just like I said we would be after last month's ""crisis"" of a government shutdown. President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday, ""I'd love to see a shutdown"" if Democrats will not accept his immigration proposals. Some of the proposals from Trump is to eliminate ""chain migration"" and alter immigration law to cut off the flow of MS-13 gang members into the US. Additionally, part of a Trump deal is to get $18 billion in funding for a southern border wall, as well as more military funding. ""If they don't want to take care of our military then shut it down,"" Trump said. ""We need much better border mechanisms and much better border security. We need the wall. We're going to get the wall,"" the president added. ""If we don't have the wall, we're never going to solve this problem."" Earlier Tuesday, Trump tweeted out a Daily Caller article which claimed a majority of Americans support a DACA compromise. The article also claims that it would fully strengthen the border and also include immigration laws changes. ""Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA, fully secures the border, ends chain migration & cancels the visa lottery,"" tweeted Trump. ""If Ds oppose this deal, they arent serious about DACA-they just want open borders.""

"Title: Climate change will get worse before it gets better: carbon combustion and catastrophic flooding.  Article: Be prepared to see more images like this in years to come. The recovery efforts from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria are barely underway, and it will be years before the full extent of the damage caused by four major hurricanes to make landfall in one season is known. However, we can already begin to see how severe the effects can be when two category 4 and two category 5 Hurricanes make landfall in quick succession: The last time the northern Leeward Islands experienced two major hurricanes in the same season was 1899, and now it is looking at three in the same month. Residents of some islands barely had time to assess the wreckage of a Category 5 hurricane before another bore down on them. Others fled their homes to escape Irma, only to find themselves in the cross hairs of Maria. A full reckoning of 2017s place in hurricane history will not be possible until the season ends on Nov. 30, but there are a few things we can say with reasonable confidence: It will almost certainly be the most expensive season on record in the United States. That distinction, like most others, currently belongs to 2005, when Katrina and three other major hurricanes caused more than $143.5 billion of damage in the country. But this year, AccuWeather estimated that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma might cost a combined $290 billion: two storms producing double the economic damage of four in 2005. The devastation caused by these storms, and the suffering that continues, especially in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, as well as several Caribbean islands, including Dominica and Barbuda, is overwhelming.",0
"Title: America's Immigration Voice.  Article: What caused the FBI to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign in July 2016, which evolved into the criminal investigation that is said today to imperil the Trump presidency? As James Comey's FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller have, for 18 months, failed to prove Donald Trump's ""collusion"" with the Kremlin, what was it, in mid-2016, that justified starting this investigation? What was the basis for the belief Trump was colluding, that he was the Manchurian candidate of Vladimir Putin? What evidence did the FBI cite to get FISA court warrants to surveil and wiretap Trump's team? Republican congressmen have for months been demanding answers to these questions. And, as Mueller's men have stonewalled, suspicions have arisen that this investigation was, from the outset, a politicized operation to take down Trump. Feeding those suspicions has been the proven anti-Trump bias of investigators. Also, wiretap warrants of Trump's team are said to have been issued on the basis of a ""dirty dossier"" that was floating around town in 2016--but which mainstream media refused to publish as they could not validate its lurid allegations. Who produced the dossier? Ex-British spy Christopher Steele , whose dirt was delivered by ex-Kremlin agents. And Steele was himself a hireling of Fusion GPS, the oppo research outfit enlisted and paid by the Clinton campaign and DNC. Writes the Washington Times, Steele ""paid Kremlin sources with Democratic cash."" Yet, if Steele's dossier is a farrago of falsehoods and fake news, and the dossier's contents were used to justify warrants for wiretaps on Trump associates, Mueller has a problem.",0
"Title: Food Inflation Comes To America: General Mills, Kraft And Kellogg Hike Prices On Selected Food Products  Article: After denying for months that surging food prices will eventually come to the consumer, hoping that instead food companies could absorb the margin drop, sellside research is finally capitulating to the reality of what is really happening in the retail store. In a note discussing General Mills, Goldman Sachs says the company raised prices on snack bars some 7% last week. Goldman further clarifies that ""this reportedly followed a comparable increase taken by K on its snack bars in mid-December. In addition, KFT has reportedly announced a 6% increase on select Planters branded nut products. We expect more price increases to be announced by the food companies in the coming weeks."" Maybe, but the Chairman sure doesn't. And the Chairman is always 100% correct. Other observations from Goldman on what are now seen as inevitable price increases across numerous food verticals. These pricing actions support our Food sector view that price momentum will continue to build as 2011 progresses, driven by easing promotional spending and list price increases (see our 1/5 report, Time to embrace inflation; Upgrade Food to Neutral, GIS to buy). This should drive top-line acceleration and margin stabilization over the course of 2011. Evidence of the progression is already apparent in retail scanner data (see our 1/11 report, Progression to a less bad promo environment continues). Scanner data is likely to continue to show a measured pace of price growth.",0
"Title: Saudi man loses right to drive after undergoing sex change surgery  Article: A religious court in Saudi Arabia has decided this morning to invalidate the drivers license of a man because he underwent an operation to become a woman. 34-year old Abulrahiim al-Qahtani, now known as Salsabyl al-Qahtani, underwent a sex change operation in Germany in November 2015 and lived there for over two years. She decided to return to Saudi Arabia in December, and her parents left a car for her at the airport so she could drive by herself to their residence. Unfortunately for her, she was arrested by members of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPV), the Saudi religious police. Even if she still had a valid Saudi drivers license, she was immediately arrested by the religious police and her vehicle was seized. She spent 17 days in prison before her familys lawyers and foreign non-governmental organizations were able to obtain her liberation. Her drivers license was still revoked, however, and her case was transferred to the Islamic tribunal. This morning, after less than two hours of deliberation, she was declared mentally unfit to drive a vehicle by an Islamic court, in Jeddah. The three judges declared that Ms. al-Qahtanis desire to become a woman, by itself, proves that she has mental problems. Allah created man in his own image.",0

The plague of Islamic terrorism is based on grievances against Israelso says Al Azhar, the worlds most prestigious madrasa (or Muslim university) that co-hosted Barrack Obamas 2009 A New Beginning speech. During a recently televised Egyptian interview, Ahmed Al TayebAl Azhars grand imam, once named the most influential Muslim in the worldsaid:  I have noticed that they are always telling us that terrorism is Islamic. All those mouthpieces that croakout of ignorance or because they were told tothat the Al-Azhar curricula are the cause of terrorism never talk about Israel, about Israels prisons, about the genocides perpetrated by the Zionist entity state. If not for the abuse of the region by means of the Zionist entity, there would never have been any problem. The Middle East and the region would have progressed, and the Arab individual would have been like any other person in the world, enjoying a good life, or at least enjoying the right to live in peace. Theres certainly much to comment on here. First, Al Azhar has in fact been exposed time and time again teaching the same anti-infidel and supremacist doctrines that groups like the Islamic State rely on. After being asked why Al Azhar, which is in the habit of denouncing secular thinkers as un-Islamic, refuses to denounce the Islamic State as un-Islamic, Sheikh Nasr, a scholar of Islamic law and graduate of Al Azhar, said:  It cant [condemn the Islamic State as un-Islamic]. The Islamic State is a byproduct of Al Azhars programs. So can Al Azhar denounce itself as un-Islamic?",0
"Title: Runoff Time! Texas goes back to the polls next week  Article: TX-Sen: There's not a whole lot to write about the Democratic runoff. Former state Rep. Paul Sadler faces off with political unknown Grady Yarbrough, who hasn't made any filings with the FEC and doesn't even have a website, in a race in which Sadler should win pretty handily -- but it's been nearly impossible to get a read on the Texas Democratic primary electorate. (After all, it was a shocker that Yarbrough even made it to the runoff to begin with; most thought that Sean Hubbard would join Sadler in the runoff. ) But, assuming Sadler does win, he's probably going to get swamped in the general election by whomever prevails in the Republican runoff between Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst and former state Solicitor General Ted Cruz. The Dewhurst campaign, in spite of raising and spending $$24 million, is showing just how difficult establishment Republican politicians have it these days. Dewhurst is a conservative, no doubt, but to the Teabaggers he's not conservative enough because as Lieutenant Governor, he actually had to get bills passed through the state Senate and couldn't just sit back and vote against anything that included a ""tax"" or some sort of ""government spending."" After all, the state of Texas needed to have policies set. Unlike, say, Ted Cruz, who when not serving as Solicitor General has mostly been a private citizen and therefore can say ""I've never voted for a tax increase or a spending increase and I never will!""",0
"Title: American Border Patrol Feature  Article: Trump: Moving toward border accountability? ~~~ /// ~~~ Blas Nunez-Neto --The Rand Blog -- December 9, 2017 The Big Border Security Question The U.S. needs a better understanding of the number of illegal border crossings A U.S. senator I once worked for was fond of saying that you can't manage what you can't measure. This old management adage holds true across a variety of disciplines, and is something that members of Congress should keep in mind as they debate what a secure border looks like and what kind of security measures are needed along the U.S. border with Mexico this fall. Despite investing billions of dollars since 9/11, it is still a struggle to measure how effective U.S. border security operations are. The Department of Homeland Security has decades of statistics concerning apprehensions made by Border Patrol agents, which have reached modern lows in recent years. However, apprehensions are output measures  what they actually measure are the activity of the Border Patrol. They tell us very little about how the Border Patrol is actually performing. In fact, over the years DHS officials have sometimes pointed to both increases and decreases in apprehensions as evidence that the Border Patrol is being more effective. In order to actually understand how effective Border Patrol operations are, however, you need to know the number of people that attempted to cross the border illegally.",0
"Title: First Baby Born in Texas with Zika-Linked Microcephaly  Article: Texas public health officials confirmed the birth of a baby boy in Harris County with Zika-linked microcephaly, the congenital birth defect where a newborns head and brain are only partially developed. This marks the first live birth of a baby with Zika-related microcephaly in the Lone Star State. Microcephaly is one of the worst tragedies related to Zika virus infection. We are sad to report that we now have our first case of Zika-associated microcephaly and our hearts go out to the family, said Umair A. Shah, MD. MPH, executive director of Harris County Public Health (HCPH). advertisement The birth defect stunts the developing babys brain and head from growing fully. With its link to microcephaly, Zika poses a serious threat to unborn children. Its heartbreaking. This underscores the damage Zika can have on unborn babies, said Dr. John Hellerstedt, Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) commissioner.

"Title: Australian Pro-Life Groups Say New PM a Pro-Abort, Feminist Radical  Article: News By Hilary White CANBERRA, August 10, 2010 (LifeSiteNews.com)  Pro-family campaigners have warned that Julia Gillard, elected in June as Australias new Prime Minister, is a radical feminist whose unqualified support for abortion and the homosexualist agenda is reflected in the constitution of Australias Emilys List, a group that gives financial support to far left, feminist, pro-abortion and homosexualist candidates. Gillard recently said in an interview posted to the website of Emilys List that she was asked to be a founder of the group by Victoria state Premier Joan Kirner, and to use my legal skills to write its constitution. In the interview, Gillard praised the group for placing a number of other pro-abortion feminists into significant roles in government, including the cabinet. Among others, she named Jennifer Macklin, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and Nicola Roxon, the Minister for Health and Ageing. Gillard, a self-described atheist and the first female Prime Minister of Australia, is the head of the Australian Labour party and cohabits with her hairdresser boyfriend, Tim Mathieson. At university, Gillard was a student activist, supporting a broad range of left-wing causes. She rose to be head of the radical Australian Union of Students and acted as a senior official in the Socialist Forum.

The announcement was made at a speech attended by over 10,000 citizens and by several other African leaders and heads of state, as well as international observers. Mugabe noted that All through history, whites have done nothing but exploit other races. Whites are an oppressive, abusive, dishonest, criminal, and evil race as they themselves admit! We have decided, therefore, to exterminate every white man, woman, and child in Zimbabwe. We will purify our Black African nation of the disease of whiteness. I will show them no mercy. I will show them a new definition of pain. I will finally deliver justice to our people! To thunderous applause and a standing ovation, Mugabe continued speaking. We will show no mercy even to white children. We will grab the suckling baby from its mothers breast and break its neck. We will beat the mother to death with the babys corpse. I will rip the babies from the wombs of white women and strangle them with my bare hands! We know that white babies will only grow up to be oppressive white racists! I am not afraid to get my hands dirty. I look forward to personally participating in the slaughter! It will be a beautiful genocide against an evil race!

"Title: NEO  Crimea, China and Alternative Trade Routes  Article: [ Editors note: One of the reasons that growth is so key to a nations future is that it creates demand for infrastructure projects, which in developed countries increases the velocity of money when the components and labor are local. Modern US problems with this model have included the large presence of many Mexican workers on American construction projects prior to our collapse. For third world countries, we find huge equipment imports associated with big projects, where the local labor money stays, but no demand for the bigger ticket machinery items is ever created. When the projects are done, the anticipated ripple effect is a fizzle, as the profits generated are further spent on imports of parked offshore. China has weathered the world recession with continued growth because of its continued domestic development and also its well-diversified export portfolio, the envy of the world actually. Thus, the US elites recast this success as a national security threat to the US declining economy, and decided to use its forward military deployment to threaten Chinas trading routes, those going to China with energy, and then its ocean-carried exports. Washingtons pitiful spin-meistering that this policy is driven by commitment to protect its security partners from some growing Chinese military menace is laughable, if it were not so sad. Unlike the US, the Chinese do not establish military bases along their trade routes as the price of doing business with them. Why would China want to project a future military threat that would divert potential trade revenues into the hands of the military industrial complex (America) versus expanding trade with them?",0
"Title: NSA Deleted Surveillance Data It Was Under Court Order To Maintain In Electronic Frontier Foundation Lawsuit  Article: And the hits of the Deep State just keep on coming! Apparently, the National Security Agency (NSA) admitted to US District Court Judge Jeffrey White on Thursday that they destroyed internet surveillance data that a court had ordered it to secure and maintain in a lawsuit brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. According to recent court filings, the NSA didn't take the necessary steps it told the court it would ensure the data was not destroyed. Politico reports:  Since 2007, the NSA has been under court orders to preserve data about certain of its surveillance efforts that came under legal attack following disclosures that President George W. Bush ordered warrantless wiretapping of international communications after the 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. In addition, the agency has made a series of representations in court over the years about how it is complying with its duties. However, the NSA told U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey White in a filing on Thursday night and another little-noticed submission last year that the agency did not preserve the content of internet communications intercepted between 2001 and 2007 under the program Bush ordered. To make matters worse, backup tapes that might have mitigated the failure were erased in 2009, 2011 and 2016, the NSA said. The NSA sincerely regrets its failure to prevent the deletion of this data, NSAs deputy director of capabilities, identified publicly as Elizabeth B., wrote in a declaration filed in October. NSA senior management is fully aware of this failure, and the Agency is committed to taking swift action to respond to the loss of this data.",1

Is it common practice for the state Democratic and Republican parties in the other 49 states to not report donations to their secretary of state's offices? Is it common for them to ignore the law which requires that they disclose to donors when a check will be deposited into a ""Federal"" account? Here in New Hampshire, Democrats lost more than 15 house seats in a year when the rest of the nation turned bluer. Perhaps if some of that money had not gone into a ""Federal"" account, and had instead gone into helping State candidates things would be different. Most Democratic legislators agree, we would probably have passed legislation that offered property tax relief (i.e. an income tax) and would have abolished the death penalty if we had 15 more Democrats sitting in the House this biennium. This improper fundraising practice allows an oligarchy, instead of the State Committee, to decide on whom the money will be spent.",0
"Title: Two State Dissolution: Hamas Blamed for PLO PM Assassination Plot  Article: That ""Two State Solution"" that is an article of faith from AIPAC to the DNC is certainly doing well. Not just the Israel-PLO Solution, but dividing PLO territory up between Hamas and the PLO. Here's the latest report about what those crazy terrorist kids have been up to. Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah survived an assassination attempt in northern Gaza on Tuesday morning, according to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency. Hamdallah, who was making a short trip to the coastal enclave to mark the opening of a new water treatment facility, had just passed through the Erez border crossing from Israel when a bomb detonated near his convoy, tearing the siding off at least one black SUV and blowing out the car's windows. No one was injured in the attack, said Iyad Al-Bozom, spokesman for the Palestinian Ministry of Interior and National Security, in a Facebook post. Palestinian Authority Minister of Intelligence Majid Faraj, a close ally of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbbas, was also in the convoy. In a sign of longstanding animosity between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, Fatah -- which governs the West Bank and controls the Palestinian Authority -- immediately blamed the Islamist movement in Gaza for the attack. Before trying to bring peace between Israel and the Islamic colonial terrorists, maybe they should make peace between the rival terrorist groups? If they can't get along with each other, how are they supposed to get along with the hated Jews? Hamdallah is making his third visit to Gaza following the beginning of reconciliation efforts between the Authority and Hamas late last year.",1
"Title: 509 unborn babies killed every day in UK as abortions increase nationwide  Article: NewsAbortion May 17, 2016 (SPUC) -- The latest abortion figures show that on average, 509 unborn babies were killed by abortion every single day in 2015 in England and Wales alone. The figures released today by the Department of Health show that the overall number of abortions taking place in England and Wales in 2015 was 0.7% higher than in 2014. In total, 185,824 abortions were performed on English & Welsh residents last year. Disabled babies especially vulnerable Additionally, the figures show a rise in repeat abortions and abortions carried out on the grounds of disability. There were 3,213 abortions for disability - a 3.7% increase on 2014. 38% of abortions were repeat abortions, performed on women who had had at least one abortion previously. Abortion funding 30% of abortions were performed in NHS hospitals, but more than two-thirds were sub-contracted to external clinics, run by abortion chains like BPAS and Marie Stopes. This figure has risen dramatically over the last 20 years and represents one of the key growth strategies of the abortion industry. In total, nearly all abortions (98%) were funded by taxpayers. Commenting on todays figures, Anthony McCarthy, a bioethicist said: ""Although the abortion industry would like us to get used to these figures, I think people not invested in it will be appalled that over 180,000 unborn children were taken from us last year, the vast majority for social reasons. This has nothing to do with medicine and everything to do with business models which betray women and their unborn children.",1

"Title: Russia Blocks Investigation of Syrian Chemical Weapons  Article: The mandate of an international expert panel investigating use of chemical weapons in Syria, known as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), has expired. JIM was established by the United Nations Security Council, unanimously, in 2015 to identify to the greatest extent feasible individuals, entities, groups or governments perpetrating, organizing, sponsoring or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals as weapons in Syria. With its mandate about to come to an end if not renewed by another Security Council resolution, Russia killed it with two vetoes late last week. That brings to 11 the number of times that Russia has moved to block a Security Council resolution dealing with Syria since the conflict broke out there six years ago. The original draft resolution submitted by the United States would have extended the Joint Investigative Mechanisms mandate by a year and affirmed the methodological and evidentiary standards employed in JIMs investigations. Russia would have none of that, however. It sought to discredit the JIM panel after it released its report on October 26, 2017 finding that the Syrian regime had been responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Shaykhun on April 4, 2017. The panel had also found that ISIS was responsible for the use of sulfur mustard at Umm Hawsh in September 2016. In order to protect its ally in the future against anything that smacked of accountability for its brutality, Russia vetoed the U.S. draft resolution. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley was unsparing in her criticism of Russias obstructionism following Russias veto of the U.S.-sponsored draft resolution.",1
"Title: A woman can go to Heaven, as long as shes accompanied by a male relative claims Saudi Imam  Article: The conservative Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is slowly but surely opening to an increased role for women in society, as for the first time in the countrys history, an important religious leader has declared it possible for women to be admitted into Heaven. In a sermon he delivered at the Prophets Mosque in Medina last Friday, the progressive Imam Sheikh Salah Al-Budair declared that women can be admitted into heaven, as long as they are accompanied by Mahram relatives (male kin, who is not suitable for marriage under Islamic law). I know that I will shock many people by saying this, but I think that women can indeed be admitted into Heaven. , the Imam preached. The Prophet said No woman should travel except with a Mahram. Ascending to heaven is the greatest trip in every good muslims existence. I dont believe that the Prophet meant this trip to be an exception. I think that a woman can get into Heaven, as long as shes accompanied by a man of her family. This, of course, implies that at least one man in her family needs to be admitted himself This surprising declaration is in complete rupture with the countrys traditional hard line, which states that woman can never be admitted into Heaven, under any circumstances. A group of conservative scholars and religious leaders from across Saudi Arabia, overseen by the countrys ministry of Islamic Affairs, signed a declaration condemning the Imams sermon as a blasphemy, and reaffirming that only men are worthy of going to Heaven. Its our responsibility to spread the true word of God, and all irresponsible people like Sheikh al-Budair are tarnishing Islam are contrary to the teachings of the Quran and the Hadith.",0

"Title: North Korea Executes Prominent General For Racist Comments  Article: By Ray Charlston A shocking racist incident took place in Pyongyang, North Korea, Tuesday of last week. Basketball player Dennis Rodman returned to the DPRK, at the special invitation of General Kim Jong-un, who himself is an avid and long time basketball fan. Rodman had been invited to attend a state parade in honor of North Korean basketball players. This extravagant eight-hour long parade, featured what is believed to be the largest inflatable basketball ever created. According to some South-Korean analysts, attendance at the parade, as well as flag waving, was reported to be compulsory for all Pyongyang residents. Jung Go-Wong, a prominent middle-aged general in the Korean Peoples Army, was to introduce Rodman who was invited to say a few words before the beginning of the event. Not realizing that his microphone was turned on already, the general turned to his wife and stated that Korean people are uniquely virtuous, owing to the purity of our blood since ancient times. Rodman is nothing but a dumb ugly ape! I dont know why Kim Jong-un would invite this beast to visit again. I am so tired of him and his stupid monkey antics, he belongs in a zoo! Last time Rodman was this drunk he was defecating in the hotel hallway! The aghast audience, including the Korean public as well as top North Korean officials reportedly looked on in horror as they were subjected to outrageous racist hate speech. Technicians struggled to find a way to cut the microphone, as the ghastly and obscene verbal offense continued. General Jung Go-Wong went on to say to his wife Did you see the way he looked at our daughter?",1

Some white witnesses allege that Williams told the Santa that he had been good all year long, but barely got shit last year. In his long angry tirade, white witnesses claim that he told the mall Santa he was going to bust a cap in his fat white ass if he failed to comply with his demands for presents.

"Title: Islamic Terrorists and Gay Targets  Article: Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. A few days before the second anniversary of the Pulse massacre in Orlando, Florida, two Muslim terrorists were arrested in a plot to attack gay targets in France. There may be no connection beyond coincidence, but the media would have normally made one anyway if it werent avoiding the subject. The aftermath of Omar Mateens killing spree was one of the modern medias low points. And these days thats a competitively low bar. Cable news ignored Omars declaration that he was an Islamic terrorist and instead wildly speculated that he was secretly gay and homophobic at the same time. Its been established conclusively that the ISIS terrorist wasnt gay. He may not have even known that he was about to open fire in a gay nightclub. His original target had been the Disney Springs mall. And his message began with, In the name of Allah. ISIS has recorded propaganda videos of its fighters fully implementing Sharia law by hurling gay men off buildings. But after the medias misleading coverage, it appeared to urge future attackers to avoid targets where their intentions might be misinterpreted. ISIS had managed to pull of its deadliest attack in America only to have it be attributed to repressed homosexuality instead of the glorious caliphate. A year later, Amer Alhaggagi was indicted for aiding ISIS and plotting murderous terror attacks. 'I'm going to place a bomb in a gay club, Wallah or by Allah,' he allegedly said.",1

The audio, released on the SoundCloud account of a local news reporter, is an almost three hour recording of transmissions between dispatch and units on the ground amid the confusion of the mass shooting that at one point details a report that a wife of a firefighter was actually pinned down in the Foundation Room bar on top of the Mandalay Hotel. Intellihubs Shepard Ambellas, who has extensively reported on the entire Vegas cover-up since the beginning, recently found that at around the 1:27:54 mark of the audio file you can clearly hear dispatch describing the situation to first responders who are headed in that direction.

Batallion 6, be advised that we are getting reports on Mandalay Bay, at the bar, we currently have, another active shooter up there.

Article: This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse  The 2018 mid-term elections are going to be all about Donald Trump, and Republican candidates all over the nation need to make it clear where they stand. Either you are with Trump and want to support his agenda, or you are running for Congress for some other reason. Personally, I am making it exceedingly clear where I stand. My new campaign signs have Vote Pro-Trump emblazoned right across the top, and the first thing that visitors to my campaign website see is a pro-Trump slogan. Trump supporters all over Idaho are pouring into our campaign, and many of them are extremely enthusiastic. In fact, one of our supporters made some incredibly funny modifications to our new campaign sign, and you can see his work right here. When Meranda saw that, she literally couldnt stop laughing. And without a doubt that meme is quite over the top, but it just illustrates how people are feeling about our campaign. I believe that any Republican that is running for Congress should be unashamedly pro-Trump, and I dont understand those that are trying to distance themselves from the president. Here in Idaho, a number of my opponents have absolutely no intention of helping Donald Trump once they get into office, and that is why it is so imperative that we win this race. With less than four months to go, the numbers tell us that it is an extremely close race and up to two-thirds of the voters are still completely undecided.

Having considered materials of the case against Navalny and Pyotr Ofitserov, the court established that Navalny masterminded the embezzlement, judge Sergei Blinov said at the trial. Ofitserov was found guilty of assisting the embezzlement, the judge said. The Leninsky District Court of Kirov started to hear the criminal case on embezzlement from the Kirovles company on April 17. The prosecution claims that more than 10,000 cubic meters of timber was stolen from Kirovles between May and September 2009, inflicting damages of more than 16 million rubles on the Kirov region's administration.

While I had agreed that Saddam Hussein was a regional threat and a tyrranical ruler and believed that a regime change needed to happen, and that would require force from outside Iraq. But I later learned that our invasion was based on a pack of lies, poorly planned, poorly executed, and justified by politicians with an agenda dangerous to America and the world. I see many paralles with Israel's invasion and reoccupation of Lebanon. I am not trying to beatify Hezbollah, or even call them the good guys, but the IDF intentions are being reverse swift boated by the American MSM into a war of good vs evil. The Bush misadministration had planned the inevitable invasion of Iraq long before 9/11 and long before UN inspectors came up empty. The case for war was based on lies and known faulty intelligence, while good intelligence was ignored if it didn't suit the need. These lies were sold to the American people, then to the international community through the UN. Bush finally got his war, and the lies became well known. But it didn't matter anymore, we were the good guys and had to stay the course at great cost in lives, dollars and reputation. All the while tens of thousands of Iraqis were killed and that nation sank into civil war. We are being told that Israel was minding its own business on its Lebanese border, until Hezbollah invaded Israel and fired some rockets at Haifa and other northern cities.

"Title: Where have all the men gone?  Article: OpinionFaith September 16, 2016 (BreakPoint) -- Are we in the midst of a masculinity crisis? Two Christian writers offered very different answers to this question in recent articles. David French at National Review laments a new statistic that shows todays young men are, physically, the weakest generation in recorded history. If youre the average Millennial male, he writes, your dad is stronger than you are. In fact, you may not be stronger than the average Millennial femaleThe very idea of manual labor is alien to you, and even if you were asked to help, say, build a back porch, the task would exhaust you to the point of uselessness. Welcome to the new, post-masculine reality. Chandler Epp replied to French in a guest column at Religion News Service, arguing that the idea of masculinity being equivalent to physical strength is misguided. Popular Christian notions of manhood, he writes, shame, repel, and ruin too many young boys and men who fail to meet those standards and who dont gravitate toward typical masculine behaviors. He concludes, We must recover the idea that the marker of a true man is his moral strength, not his muscular fitness. Now I know personally both Chandler and French, and I have a lot of respect for them both. In fact, they both demonstrate that sort of moral strength Chandler talks about in his piece. Chandler is right that when most folks ask, Where are all the men? what they mean is something like, where are all the lumberjacks?",0

Christian women are kidnapped, raped or threatened with being sold into slavery by their abductors. Meanwhile, Christian churches keep disappearing from the Middle East after being demolished and ransacked. Recently, radical Islamic State jihadists released a video in which they tossed Bibles and other Christian artifacts into a raging bonfire. As this onslaught against the worlds largest faith unfolds, the Obama administration has inexplicably remained passive. While Pope Francis, the United Nations, the Knights of Columbus, the European Council, and Congress have all called these atrocities genocide, the Obama White House has thus far failed to acknowledge it. Obama spokesman Josh Earnest has relied on semantics and wordplay to avoid discussing the subject.

Kim Jong-un has just hosted talks with a high-level delegation from South Korea, led by its national security director Chung Eui-yong. The South Korean delegation came away believing that these talks have borne some fruit. A possible summit meeting between Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in was discussed, which could occur in late April at the so-called Peace House, which is located on the South Korean side of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone. In the meantime, the two Koreas have reportedly agreed to set up a telephone hotline between the leaders of both countries. The South Koreans also indicated that North Korea would agree to halt tests of its nuclear weapons and missiles in conjunction with opening talks with the United States on the denuclearization issue. According to Chung Eui-yong, the North Koreans are looking for a credible security guarantee and the end to military threats against it, in which case they believed they would not need to keep their nuclear arsenal. He claimed that North Korea was interested ""in an open-ended dialogue to discuss the issue of denuclearization and to normalize relations with North Korea."" Notably, Kim Jong-un is said to have withdrawn, at least for now, his insistence that the United States and South Korea suspend their joint military exercises as a precondition to any negotiations.",0

White House Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert admitted it. Axios: I recommend that today and tomorrow we use the general theme of supporting the governor and standing with the people of Puerto Rico to get them food, water, shelter and emergency medical care. Monday and Tuesday we can pivot hopefully to a theme of stabilizing as we address temporary housing and sustaining the flow of commodities and basic government services, including temporary power. After that we focus on restoration of basic services throughout next week and next weekend. Then we start a theme of recovery planning for the bright future that lies ahead for Puerto Rico. Planned hits, tweets, tv bookings and other work will limit the need for reactionary efforts. The storm caused these problems, not our response to it. We have pushed about as much stuff and people through a tiny hole in as short a timeframe as possible.

"Title: New research suggests fracking is probably poisoning the air  Article: Trees may be brown because of the seasons, not the air quality Trees may be brown because of the seasons, not the air quality The researchers found that hydraulic fracturing -- a technique for releasing natural gas from below-ground rock formations -- emits pollutants known as PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), including some that are linked with increased risk of cancer and respiratory ailments. ""Air pollution from fracking operations may pose an under-recognized health hazard to people living near them,"" said the study's coauthor Kim Anderson, an environmental chemist with OSU's College of Agricultural Sciences. Haynes got in touch with Anderson and Kincl, and together they designed the study to include citizen participation. They placed air samplers on the properties of 23 volunteers living or working at sites ranging from right next to a gas well to a little more than three miles away. The samplers picked up high levels of PAHs across the study area. Levels were highest closest to the wells and decreased by about 30 percent with distance. Even the lowest levels -- detected on sites more than a mile away from a well -- were higher than previous researchers had found in downtown Chicago and near a Belgian oil refinery. They were about 10 times higher than in a rural Michigan area with no natural gas wells. The team also accounted for the influences of wood smoke and vehicle exhaust, common sources of airborne pyrogenic PAHs. Wood smoke was consistent across the sampling area, supporting the conclusion that the gas wells were contributing to the higher PAH levels.",0

Yet, the worst place to be caught drug trafficking is in the Philippines, where thousands have died in extra-judicial killings. In the United States, not only can some drug offenses result in life in prison, the sentence of death can be carried out on a defendant who has been found guilty of manufacturing, importing or distributing a controlled substance if the act was committed as part of a continuing criminal enterprise.

But talking about the death penalty for drug dealers is one of the most outrageously dumb things he has ever said. Free Trade or Protecti... Laurence M.

Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that. Then it was reported that Trump has privately told a number of people that he supports executing drug dealers. And just the other day, speaking at a White House summit on the opioid epidemic, Trump said this:  Some countries have a very, very tough penalty. The ultimate penalty. And by the way they have much less of a drug problem than we do. So were going to have to be very strong on penalties.",1
"Title: Can America Ever Come Together Again?  Article: Shop all books by Patrick Buchanan  If ex-CIA Director John Brennan did to Andrew Jackson what he did to Donald Trump, he would have lost a lot more than his security clearance. He would have been challenged to a duel and shot. Trumps  performance in Helsinki, Brennan had said, exceeds the threshold of high crimes & misdemeanors. It was  treasonous. Why should the president not strip from a CIA director who calls him a traitor the honor and privilege of a security clearance? Or is a top-secret clearance an entitlement like Social Security?

"Title: San Francisco gives pot prohibitionists the finger  Article: Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. San Francisco officials are retroactively applying the citys marijuana legalization laws, a move that will help thousands of residents convicted of pot-related crimes over the decades expunge or reduce the convictions. The San Francisco Chronicle reported:  The move will affect thousands of people whose marijuana convictions brand them with criminal histories that can hurt chances for finding jobs and obtaining some government benefits. Proposition 64, which state voters passed in November 2016, legalized the recreational use of marijuana in California for those 21 and older and permitted the possession up to one ounce of cannabis. The legislation also allows those with past marijuana convictions that would have been lesser crimes  or no crime at all  under Prop. 64 to petition a court to recall or dismiss their cases. Rather than leaving it up to individuals to petition the courts  which is time consuming and can cost hundreds of dollars in attorney fees  Gascn said San Francisco prosecutors will review and wipe out convictions en masse. The district attorney said his office will dismiss and seal more than 3,000 misdemeanor marijuana convictions in San Francisco dating back to 1975, and review and re-sentence thousands of felony marijuana cases. The move comes as the Jeff Sessions Department of Justice continues to work to remind state and local governments that federal law still prohibits the sale and use of the plant throughout the United States. San Francisco, however, is certainly not alone in pushing back against Sessions anti-pot crusade.",0

Thank you! Al-Sadoon said: It was all about money  people exaggerating sometimes what they see. He blamed the British legal system for making it so easy. Indeed. British authorities, primed with endless victimhood posturing by Muslims in Britain, were ready and willing to see British troops in Iraq as abusive, racist, Islamophobic louts, and eager to pay for such stories. This is why we see so many anti-Muslim hate crimes faked by Muslims in the U.S. and the West in general: becoming a victim brings one laudatory press attention, and in many cases money and special favors. It was a racket, all of it indeed. It was a racket, all of it: Iraqi refugee admits faking hundreds of compensation claims against British troops while working for man paid 1.6m by law firm, by Miles Dilworth, Daily Mail, February 14, 2018 (thanks to David):  An Iraqi refugee has admitted arranging hundreds of fake abuse claims against British soldiers in Iraq. Basim Al-Sadoon, 37, said the racket he was involved in was aimed at winning payouts from the Ministry of Defence. Mr Al-Sadoon ran an office in Basra where he handled accusations made by locals against the British Army. He said clients exaggerated claims, produced bogus paperwork and falsely accused soldiers of wrongdoing. It was a racket, all of it, he told The Sun. All these people cared about was money. It was like a claims factory and it didnt matter if the claims were true or false. Mr Al-Sadoon was hired by UK-based Iraqi Mazin Younis.",1
"Title: America Fundamentally Transformed  Article: In the spring of 2007 I was teaching a small class of non-traditional students, some as young as eighteen and some older than I was. It was an interesting mixture of blacks, whites, Hispanics, civilians and military who had jobs during the day and took classes at night to finish their college degrees. They were not the pampered and entitled snowflakes of today; they were hard-working Americans from all walks of life, some receiving Pell grants and some on military scholarships. We always had interesting discussions as most brought their experience to class to contribute to our economic lessons. A few detracted from it with their unruly and disrespectful behavior. It was a bit too late to teach social manners to the two young black women who always arrived late, answered their phones in the classroom, and left often for bathroom breaks but returned with sodas, hamburgers, and fries from the nearby bowling alley. Everyone was hungry, most students did not get a chance to get supper but some were patient enough to wait for the large break between the three-hour long classes before they bought food. take our poll - story continues below  Who will cave first over the government shutdown?

"Title: FBI Quietly Ramps Up Biometrics Programs  Article: By Jennifer Lynch In the last few years, FBI has been dramatically expanding its biometrics programs, whether by adding face recognition to its vast Next Generation Identification (NGI) database or pushing out mobile biometrics capabilities for time-critical situations through its Repository for Individuals of Special Concern (RISC). But two new developmentsboth introduced with next to no media attentionwill impact far more every-day Americans than anything the FBI has done on biometrics in the past. FBI Combines Civil And Criminal Fingerprints Into One Fully Searchable Database Being a job seeker isnt a crime. But the FBI has made a big change in how it deals with fingerprints that might make it seem that way. For the first time, fingerprints and biographical information sent to the FBI for a background check will be stored and searched right along with fingerprints taken for criminal purposes. The change, which the FBI revealed quietly in a February 2015 Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), means that if you ever have your fingerprints taken for licensing or for a background check, they will most likely end up living indefinitely in the FBIs NGI database. Theyll be searched thousands of times a day by law enforcement agencies across the countryeven if your prints didnt match any criminal records when they were first submitted to the system. This is the first time the FBI has allowed routine criminal searches of its civil fingerprint data. Although employers and certifying agencies have submitted prints to the FBI for decades, the FBI says it rarely retained these non-criminal prints.",1
"Title: Veterinarian accused of having sex with more than 300 dogs  Article: A renowned veterinarian from Trenton in Missouri was arrested this morning after being filmed by a security camera while having sex with several dogs. According to the Trenton Police Department, an investigation was launched on Dr. James Thompson in January, after several dog owners filed complaints about their dogs suffering from anal bleeding after visiting his clinic. During the investigation, the police convinced the owners of the West Trenton Animal Hospital, where Dr. Thompson practiced, to install several new security cameras around the building. The police and the owners were completely shocked when they saw the video footage a few weeks later. Over a period of two weeks, Dr. Thompson was filmed sexually aggressing 19 different dogs, mostly smaller breeds like miniature poodles, bichons, and chihuahuas. TPD spokesman Lt. Frank Simmons says the aggressions were rather violent and must have been traumatizing for the animals. He would put a cone-shaped collar around the animals neck so he wouldnt get bit, then hed grab it and have sex with it in various positions. According to Lt. Simmons, the veterinarian could have made a great number of victims. After interrogating the staff and customers, we collected evidence concerning at least 300 victims, but there could be thousands over his 17 years of practice. A total of 352 criminal charges have been filed against him, and the TPD says this number will probably double over the next few days. Dr.",1
"Title: The Media Blames Everything But the Daily News' Leftist Slant for its Collapse  Article: If you're not a New Yorker, you probably know the Daily News largely from its desperate trolling covers. Lately this has involved badly photoshopped pictures of Trump devouring babies while wearing clown makeup supplemented by a Linda Stasi article calling for the murder of all Republicans. If you're thinking that this smacks of desperation, you're right. The Daily News is cutting much of its staff and pivoting to digital. Its long running feud with the New York Post is over. And the Post won. (Not that in the long run any paper can or will win.) But one of the many things that killed the Daily News was its hatred of Trump. Back in the day, it was a working class tabloid. Then it became a shrieky lefty troll while leaving its audience behind. The previous editor, Jim Rich, had been resisting pressure from management to soften the Trump covers, people familiar with the matter said. He was told they were diminishing an already much diminished print subscriber base, these people said, particularly among blue-collar readers in certain corners of New Yorks outer boroughs, where Trumps nationalistic populism apparently resonates in a way that is anathema to the citys cosmopolitan districts and immigrant enclaves... Now, many News staffers and alumni feel like the air has been sucked out of the room, and they are perhaps coming to terms with the notion that Trump is more popular with segments of their readership than they thought, even in deep blue New York. Problem solved. The latest death throes of the News occasioned shrill attacks on Tronc, which bought it for nothing, from its media allies. It's not Tronc's fault that the failed tabloid is a failure.",1
"Title: Trump wants a meaner, tougher War on Drugs  Article: President Donald Trump declared this week that he wants law enforcement throughout the nation to get really, really tough, really mean with the drug pushers and drug dealers as his administration makes moves to intensify the nations failed War on Drugs. People form blue ribbon committees, they do everything they can. And, frankly, I have a different take on it. My take is, you have to get really, really tough  really mean  with the drug pushers and the drug dealers, Trump said at a recent event in Ohio. We can do all the blue ribbon committees we want. We have to get a lot tougher than we are. And we have to stop drugs from pouring across our border. Last year, Trump formed the Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis headed by Chris Christie. He also put in a call to Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte around the same time, congratulating the leader for a bloody crackdown on drug pushers in that country. I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem, Trump said at the time. Many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and I just wanted to call and tell you that. Reasons Ronald Bailey noted why thats a little disturbing for civil libertarians here in the U.S.:  Duterte is indeed doing an unbelievable job, according to Human Rights Watch. The group estimates that that Dutertes drug war has killed more than 12,000 drug suspects so far. As big a blustering blowhard as our president is, I trust that he is not actually contemplating Duterte-style extrajudicial killings when he says we have to get a lot tougher than we are.",0
"Title: Fish in Gulf of Mexico experience heart attacks due to oil contamination  Article: Bluefin tuna cannot escape or hide from heart-debilitating oil pollution Study shows how bluefin tuna experience heart attacks due to oil pollution The pollution spreads, could impact humans Kr Ca (NaturalNews) Swimming majestically in the open seas, with eyes wide on both sides of its face, the bluefin tuna gazes into... a curtain of crude oil.When the 2010 BP oil spill contaminated the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, beautiful wild fish like the bluefin tuna were forced to face new challenges for survival. Now, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Stanford University are discovering that oil pollution can elicit early heart attacks in this species of fish.These fish, which can weigh up to 550 pounds and measure 6.5 feet long, are not immune from the damaging effects of oil pollution. As one of the world's largest fish species in the world, the bluefin tuna is also built for both speed and endurance. With the ability to retract their dorsal and pectoral fins, bluefin tuna can reduce drag and swim up to 43 miles per hour. Their gorgeously colored metallic blue top and silver-white bottom help keep the fish camouflaged in the open seas, from top to bottom. But what the fish can not hide from or swim faster than is a massive oil spill. In this new study, oil pollution is found to block the bluefin tuna's cardiac tissues from receiving needed calcium and potassium, causing early heart attacks.The early die-off of these bluefin tuna in the Gulf of Mexico could mean shortages of food for those who depend on the species for survival. The oil pollution could possibly be passed upward through the food chain.",0
"Title: Erdogan's Threat to Jerusalem  Article: In an unprecedented move, President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday, December 6, 2017, that the U.S. recognizes Jerusalem as Israels official capital. In an almost 20-minute speech, President Trump said, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Trump added, For more than two decades previous presidents have signed a waiver to delay moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, and while previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver, today, I am delivering. Turkeys dictator, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is at it again, threatening Israel with cutting off diplomatic relations should the Trump administration recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital. In a meeting with a parliamentary group of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Erdogan stated that, This (referring to U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital) could go as far as cutting our diplomatic relations with Israel. You cannot take such a step. He furthermore warned the Trump administration that recognizing Jerusalem would be a red line for Muslims. He suggested that Turkey will take measures in the event of a possible U.S. move, including the convening of the 57 nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Istanbul. Erdogans bluster regarding President Trumps announcement on Jerusalem included such a far-fetched statement as, Such a move would not only be a violation of international law, but also a big blow the conscience of humanity.",0

Janice Monroe, the operator who took the call, says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation. He told me that hed fallen on his pet squirrel named Slimy and that the animal was now stuck in his anus. I was convinced that it was a teenager making a prank call. Despite Ms. Monroes doubts, she sent an ambulance to the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious. Frank Meyers, one of the paramedics who transported Mr. Frankfurt, claims the poor man was lying naked in his bathroom and a hairy red tail was protruding from his anus.

Robin noticed that:  Instead of the major assault on entitlements and welfare that Ryan had promised, he and his fellow Republicans have pushed through a domestic budget to make Barack Obama proud, as Russell Berman wrote in the Atlantic.

We constantly hear the Dem/ Main Stream Media Complex gloating that the US will be a majority non-white country by the 2040s. This prediction makes white Democrats hopeful as they naively envision a rainbow future of equality, love and electoral hegemony. It makes white Republicans despondent, as they see it as a harbinger of permanent Leftist rule and the destruction of the America they knew and cherished [Study: overhyped media narratives about Americas fading white majority fuel anxiety, By Matthew Yglesias, Vox, May 2, 2018]. But the election of Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil shows that even when whites are a minorityin Brazil they constitute just 47% of the populationpeople who value the future of the country can still win. There is little question that becoming majority-minority will be bad for the US. The more ethnically diverse a society is the more conflict there is (see Ethnic Conflicts, by Tatu Vanhanen) and the less white (or Northeast Asian) it is, the less intelligent it is, meaning chaos, corruption, and out-of-control crime (see Intelligence: A Unifying Construct for the Social Sciences, by Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen).

"Title: Comrade Merkels Suicidal Bullying  Article: For many years German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been regarded, with reason, as the most powerful woman in the world. Over the past few months, Merkels authority has diminished precipitously, however, mainly due to her irrational immigration policy. That much became obvious at last weekends emergency EU summit on immigration. The meeting was hastily convened at Merkels insistence to develop a joint European strategy to deal with the ongoing migrant onslaught. In reality, it was meant to be Operation Save Mutti: a means of preventing her governments collapse by showing that the Union can develop a tougher immigration strategy. Her goal was to ease the pressure from the Christian Social Union (CSU)her Christian Democratic Partys (CDU) Bavarian partnerwhich had threatened to leave her ruling coalition unless she agreed to end her open door policy. CSU leader Horst Seehofer had threatened to resign as Germanys interior minister unless Merkel agreed to refuse entry to migrants who had applied for asylum elsewhere in the EU, potentially forcing an early election at which the Alternative for Germany (AfD) would be likely to increase its share of the vote. This is not about whether Frau Merkel stays as Chancellor next week or not, Xavier Bettel, Luxembourgs Prime Minister, announced as he came out of the meeting in Brussels. Unwittingly (or perhaps mendaciously), he let the cat out of the bag. Indeed, the summits true objective was to appease Merkels domestic detractorsbut the task proved to be beyond her.",0
"Title: Man claims that drinking gallons of sperm cured him of homosexuality  Article: TUSCALOOSA, Alabama | A well-known naturopath and former LGBT militant claims to have cured himself of his homosexuality by drinking two glasses of sperm per day for a few months. 61-year old Brian Franklin was for several decades militant and leader of several organizations working for the promotion of LGBT rights. He says despite his activism, hes always felt uneasy about being gay and always hoped he could be cured. The professional naturopath said he spent years studying the nature of homosexuality and the chemical properties of thousands of substances. After several unsuccessful attempts with various herbs, he turned his attention to a substance which turned out to have an almost perfect chemical and hormonal properties: human semen. He created a solution composed of 95% pure human semen, in which a mix of vitamin and hormones is added. Some preliminary tests with rats produced some very promising results, so Mr. Franklin decided to test it himself. Over the last year, he ingested two glasses (600 ml) of this treatment every day and he says the results are conclusive. Only a month after I started the treatment, I began feeling less attracted to men. After six months, I was almost totally straight and I found women hot for the first time in my life! Mr. Franklin is convinced that this new scientific breakthrough could help millions of homosexuals around the world. I just drink one glass of semen in the morning and one in the evening, and I can live like a normal person.",1

While gun folks tend to love the blasted thingsyours truly includedanti-gunners see them as basically magazine-fed bazookas. Thanks to the media, which has misrepresented the weapons to the public at large, most people seem to think theyre the most deadly firearms out there. As a result, most folks look at the rifles with something like disgust following the tragedy in Parkland, FL. Yet its important to remember that the rifles arent inherently good or evil. Theyre just tools that can be used for evil, like in Parkland.

"Title: Projecting Western Logic Onto Palestinians  Article: Tom Friedman is a star columnist at the New York Times with a big ego to boot. Last week in a piece titled Hamas, Netanyahu, and Mother Nature, he displayed his biased views on Israels Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israel. Friedman blames the Israeli government for doing nothing to advance peace, a charge that is totally misplaced. Every Israeli government since the Oslo Accords were signed on the White House lawn in 1993, has attempted to reach a peace deal with the Palestinians. Prime Minister Ehud Barak made far reaching concessions at Camp David in July, 2000. Noted historian Benny Morris wrote in The New York Review of Books (June 21, 2002) that Israel proposed the establishment of a demilitarized Palestinian state on some 92 percent of the West Bank and 100 percent of the Gaza Strip, with some territorial compensation for the Palestinians from pre-1967 Israeli territory; the dismantling of most of the settlements and the concentration of the bulk of the settlers inside the 8 percent of the West Bank to be annexed by Israel; the establishment of the Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, in which some Arab neighborhoods would become sovereign Palestinian territory and others would enjoy functional autonomy; Palestinian sovereignty over half the Old City of Jerusalem (the Muslim and Christian quarters) and custodianship, though not sovereignty, over the Temple Mount; a return of refugees to the prospective Palestinian state though with no right of return to Israel proper; and the organization by the international community of a massive aid program to facilitate the refugees rehabilitation.

Italys new leaders tell 500,000 immigrants: Pack Your Bags. The right-wing Lega party, which formed a coalition government with Five-Star Movement (M5S) last week, is the driving force behind anti-immigration rhetoric and it is looking to fulfil a pledge to deport as many as 500,000 illegal migrants. Lega leader Matteo Salvini  who is now Italys deputy prime minister and interior minister  reiterated the governments aim to deport illegal migrants on a visit to Sicily last weekend. On Saturday, speaking at a rally in northern Italy, Salvini had told illegal migrants get ready to pack your bags.

The 31-year-old expectant mother suffered a stroke and was transported by a helicopter to the Neurological Clinic of Debrecen in Eastern Hungary. While the surgery was initially considered a success, sadly, she was declared brain dead two days later. An ultrasound showed that her 15-week-old preborn child was alive and very active.

On the second day when [other] examinations were carried out, we found the baby was alive and kicking well in its mothers body. Dr. Tams Szilveszter Kovcs, one of the physicians who cared for the mother and child, struggled for a time over the situation, as he was unsure whether helping a baby live when the mother died was in the best interests of the child. But after meeting with the father and grandparents he changed his mind: They convinced me that the child would mean, paradoxically, a special surviving of the mother for the grieving father and the grandparents.",0
"Title: Dresden's annihilation shown in World War Two video  Article: Harrowing footage from World War Two showing the annihilation of the German city of Dresden by Allied forces has resurfaced on the anniversary of the bombings which killed up to 25,000 people. Video from 1945, shown as part of an American news report, shows the fearsome bomb attacks undertaken by the RAF on the night of February 13. One shot from the footage shows an RAF plane being struck by an anti-aircraft gun, which the narrator describes as a 'scarecrow' in his voiceover. The clip also shows American bombers moving over the east German city the following day, where they dropped more bombs in an effort to stop Hitler's forces fending off the Soviet advance from the east. At the start of the clip, with the American narrator describing the Allied attacks, British bombers are seen high above the Saxony city. Dresden is then seen at night, with the aerial view showing the terrifying sound and light of the explosions. One British plane falls victim to the 'scarecrow', which the narrator calls 'Goebbels's secret weapon', with a frightening explosion in the sky. Some 650,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on Dresden's transportation lines by RAF Lancaster planes, according to the narrator, hampering the German forces. The bombings then continue to ravage the city before American bombers from the Eighth Air Force are seen leaving vapour trails behind them as they join in the attack.",0
"Title: Brave And Heroic Human Rights Activists Bust Up Racist Oktoberfest Hate-Events  Article: By Ray Charlston White people of German ancestry, and even some who are not, are gathering together, eating German food, listening to German music, and celebrating German heritage. This is disgusting, vile, and completely unacceptable. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a more obscene and offensive celebration, as people are seen waving German flags, and even wearing t-shirts emblazed with messages invoking German pride! As if Germans, of all people, had anything to be proud of. Germany has always been one of the worlds most backward, uneducated, uncultured, and unenlightened countries. In fact, German culture is merely composed of stolen elements from the cultures and mythologies of other peoples. Germany has produced no great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, artists, or composers in its entire history! German food is inedible, and the German language is one of the most guttural and awful of all to human ears! Because of past racial hate mongering and paranoia, German people are largely inbred, and possess none of the hybrid vigour of other nations. They are a race of ugly dwarves, of diminutive stature, with hideous faces, evil beady eyes and stunted small minds. Scientists and historians agree that Germans are among the dumbest people in the world, yet, paradoxically, they excel at developing diabolically evil plans for terrorizing other races and conquering their neighbours! Far from being part of some mythical Aryan master race, Germans are descended from Europes largely illiterate unwashed barbarian hordes, referred to as savages by ancient Roman writers! I am personally greatly ashamed of my own partial German heritage. Germany should be wiped off the map!",1

"Title: Obama Urges Us to Stop Resisting Globalization  Article: For many years, there has been a push toward a global community. This has had its benefits and its drawbacks. In the mind of the Intelligentsia, this would eventually work out world peace. As countries traded with one another and companies worked internationally, there would be greater interest for both politicians and businessmen to see the end of conflicts. At the same time, we have seen those traditionally the leaders in manufacturing, America and Britain, are suffering the loss of jobs. One of the main reason is the government: U.S. EPA and EU have made these traditional titans hamstrung in international markets. But this is also by design, as globalists know that these companies will not break with their national employees without financial pain pushing them to do so. Now, as Britain is pushing back against EU forced Islamic Invasion and the rise of Trump in this political season continues, it is becoming clear that this is not something that Americans and Brits are going to take lying down. To answer this, Obama has warned that there is no use in resisting the tide. Breitbart reports: President Barack Obama warns critics of globalization that the international economy is here to stay and that many jobs lost in the United States are not coming back. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Obama said that globalization and automation would continue to grow and urged older workers to stop resisting change. The reason for the generation gap is actually the older workers' fault.",0
"Title: Father missing since last Christmas found in chimney, dressed as Santa  Article: The remains of a 41-year old man who disappeared on Christmas Eve last year were discovered Yesterday inside the chimney of his own residence. David Milbury, a father of three from Athens in Ohio, was reported missing on Christmas last year after he left the house to prepare a surprise. A police investigation had been launched but, despite the help of the Athens County Sheriffs Office and the FBI, it hadnt been able to locate the missing man. Yesterday, his wife hired a professional sweeper to clean their houses chimney and the poor man made a gruesome discovery. In an interview with ABC, Jonas Forsythe said that what he saw in this chimney would haunt him for the rest of his life. I began sweeping as usual, but something was stuck in the vent. I pushed really hard, and I heard a loud noise. I came down to see what it was, and I saw that a body wearing a Santa costume had fallen in the fireplace. Despite the corpses state, it was rapidly identified thanks to a tattoo on its forearm and its wedding ring, which is a 240-year old family heirloom. His skin looked a bit like beef jerky, but you could still kinda recognize him.",0
"Title: Pro-Russian activists in Ukraine vow to press on with referendum on May 11  Article: Dmitry Babich told VoR: There are three days left before May 11, the preliminary date for the referendum. Since questions have not been formulated, I dont see how you can prepare bulletins in such short period of time. Basically what Vladimir Putin said was the acknowledgement of the situation on the ground but to a certain extent it was also a compromise. Mr Putin said that Ukraine is not in the state right now to hold referendums or presidential elections, even though he called the idea of having presidential elections a step in the right direction. I would not say that people in the east of Ukraine are just going to blindly follow what Mr Putin says. After all we should not forget that these people [insurgents] are dying. They lost 30 people after the artillery barrage yesterday in Slavyansk. And they are not going to change their decisions just because the president of a neighbouring country said something.  Dmitry Shibalov/ Ostrov Vladimir Putins position is pretty moderate and certainly he doesnt deserve derogatory definitions that were given to him by Mr Hague. On the other hand, Mr Putin made it clear that a presidential election in May would not be fair. You cant have a real presidential election in a country where 40 people were burned alive in one of the cities and where you have military action with the use of airplanes and tanks in another region. The confrontation inside the Ukrainian society is so great and the choice of candidates is so poor. The ones that have real chances are Yulia Tymoshenko and Petr Poroshenko  their views are not very different from each other. Certainly they will not suit the east or the south of Ukraine.",1

"Title: Going after Grover Norquist's Taxpayer Protection Pledge  Article: Caveat: I'm not particularly knowledgable about economic stuff. Worse, I may not even be very smart about economic stuff! I tend to think taxes on middle class families, and below on the economic scale, are probably as high as they should be.I know that historically, income taxes are low, but what matters to people is whether or not they can make ends meet without completely stressing out. Since people's purchasing power has declined, at least psychologically they would not feel like they should carry the same percentage tax burden that they carried 35 years ago. While I can't say that I'm particularly fond of the idea of taxing rich people more, either, if it's necessary, I don't have a problem with that. And, as we've read these past few weeks, some bona fide rich people have no problem with that, either.

Steve Kings Constitutional Amendment will stop illegal immigrants from being counted as persons in the Census  California gets 4 extra House seats, 4 extra electora  Article: Did you know that every single illegal alien in this country implicitly votes? They dont necessarily vote by casting a ballot. They vote by residing in a state. For every human that goes to sleep and wakes up in a particular state, that state can measure them as a resident. This means a state like California that has 3 million illegal aliens benefits from the presence of criminals. Those people might not vote in an election. But they dont have to. They rely on liberals to elect liberal congressmen and just by being present they enable their legal liberal counterparts to send more liberals to Congress.

"Title: Muslim Crime Stopper Sofian Zakkout's New Crush: Anti-Semite Pastor Steve Anderson  Article: For nearly two millennia, Jews have suffered persecution after persecution at the hands of those who used religion as a vehicle for hate and even mass murder. Recently, a video clip of anti-Semitic pastor Steve Anderson  making the claim that Jews have experienced such abuse because they have somehow been cursed  wound up on the personal Facebook page of South Florida Muslim leader Sofian Zakkout. According to Zakkout, who sits on the boards of two anti-crime groups, Andersons declaration makes a lot of sense. With statements like this from Zakkout and worse, why would groups committed to fighting crime continue to compromise themselves and sabotage their mission by affiliating with him? Sofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), a prominent Islamic organization headquartered in North Miami Beach, Florida. On January 25th, Zakkout posted onto his personal Facebook page a video clip of a speech made by Steve Anderson, the pastor of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona. Anderson is notorious for calling for the killing of gays to end AIDS. In the clip, Anderson states the following: And the Jews were scattered into all nations for literally 2000 years, right? For 1800 sum odd years. And by the way, everywhere they were scattered, they were persecuted, hated, treated badly. Why? Cause Gods blessing them? No. Cause theyre under the curse of God for having rejected the Lord Jesus Christ.

On the other side, Eugene Antifa, Rose City Antifa, RASH NW and the Pacific Northwest Anti-Fascist Workers Collective are hoping to bring thousands of their own members, and one organizer publicly stated that they better bring our own guns too.

Just this past weekend, Robinson attended a pro-gun rally on Saturday that opposed the Communist ideology of David Hogg and his handlers at the Florida state capitol in Tallahassee.

"Title: More Options For Trump On The Caravan: Make Applicants For Asylum Wait IN MEXICO | Blog Posts  Article: It is good to hear that finally the President is getting some good advice on how to deal with the Caravan of Death To America By Demographic Displacement. In a surprisingly fair and balanced report, CNN outlines what advice the President is considering. I am not certain how he is getting this advice, as DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen (Lady DACA) is clearly in over her head, and she does not appear to be committed to defeating the Caravan. There might be some backdoor to the President, such as Stephen Miller or L. Francis Cissna, Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Importantly, the advice filtering through to the President is just what I myself recommend, vigorous use of executive authority based on the successful Muslim Ban, but missing some other important adviceto fully and faithfully implement Expedited Removal. Ignore the misleading headline (Could Violate Federal Law), thats just CNN being CNNthe substance of the article is fair. As a migrant caravan hundreds of miles away moves toward the United States, the Trump administration is weighing its options on trying to block entry to the United States and possibly narrow the category of individuals who can apply for asylum. While the administration argues publicly that it wants to bolster US capabilities at the border, immigrant rights groups warn that if the government attempts to limit asylum seekers from receiving a fair hearing, they will rush to court. The dispute, with no firm policy in place, comes in the shadow of the midterm elections and could prompt a massive legal battle.",1

"Title: Ireland About to Give Another Sop to the Banks, a Bad Assets Fire Sale?  Article: Reader Swedish Lex, who was involved in the famed and generally well regarded Swedish banking industry cleanup of the early 1990s, read an innocuous-sounding Financial Times story the same way I did. Not only are the banks who lent recklessly to Irelands overheated property sector being shielded from most of the consequences of their stupidity and greed, but other financiers are likely to make out like bandits on what looks certain to be an unduly rapid sale of bad bank assets. For readers new to how banks get euthanized, an approach generally regarded as sound when dealing with banks that are seriously insolvent (as in their assets are worth less than their debts) is the good bank-bad bank approach. The bank is taken over, the board and senior management is fired. The good parts of the bank are usually spun back out as quickly as possible with new management in place. The bad parts, typically the bad loans, are put in a separate entity and disposed of. Now there are a lot of variants on that theme. For instance, a bank might be taken over, given a government guarantee, and have its bad assets spun out gradually (as opposed to setting up a separate bad bank entity). Some Texas banks that went bust in the late 1980s had their own bad bank entities. By contrast, the S&L crisis featured one big bad bank entity, the Resolution Trust Corporation, whose mission it was to sell the asset of failed thifts. Most of these banks had gotten into trouble with speculative real estate lending (sound familiar?)",0

While searching Riley, a police officer seized Rileys cell phone. Riley was faced charges related to a shooting that occurred weeks earlier based on photos and video the police officer found on his phone. The trial court denied Rileys motion to suppress the evidence obtained from his phone and he was convicted. The trial courts ruling on the motion to suppress was affirmed by The California court of Appeals. This case began for Brima Wurie when he was arrested in Boston for participating in a drug sale. The police seized his phone after they arrived at the police station. Thats when they noticed the phone was receiving several calls from a source my house. Police officers traced that phone number to what they suspected was Wuries apartment. That is when the police got a search warrant that lead to their discovery of drugs, a firearm and ammunition. As a result, Wurie faced drug and firearms charges. Like Riley, Wurie filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained because of the search warrant.",0
"Title: Galactic Federation Delivers Ultimatum To United Nations, Threatens To Incinerate Earth If Reasonable Demands Are Not Met Within Ten Years Time!  Article: By Ray Charlston According to anonymous sources within the United Nations, last Thursday an extra-terrestrial claiming to represent the Galactic Federation, a federation of independent planets and alien races, gave a speech before the UN. This meeting was classified as top-secret by the world body, and member nations have voted not to disclose its contents. The ambassador of the Galactic Federation, whose name is unpronounceable by humans, has indicated that they have plans to incinerate Earth, if all of their reasonable demands are not met within the next ten Earth years. The Galactic Federation has demanded that Earth end all economic disparities among racial, ethnic and national groups. Quoting Karl Marx, the ambassador stated that Earths new motto must be From each according to his abilities, to each according to his need. Warning that they will not permit humans to contaminate the galaxy with racism, income inequality, or to possibly enslave and exploit the inhabitants of other planets, the Galactic Federation has also demanded that all Earth governments agree to complete nuclear disarmament. Providing instructions for how to achieve complete economic equality, the ambassador observed that Governments must engage in income redistribution. Governments must tax citizens and then redistribute funds to them in order to achieve complete equality. Explaining that humans differ in abilities, intelligence, and work ethics, it (his race reportedly has no gender) went on to note that it will take a strong and authoritarian world government in order to achieve complete equality, which is humanitys most noble aspiration.",0
"Title: Saudi-American Muslim Psychiatrist Diagnoses Woman With Disobedient Wife Disorder  Article: By Ray Charlston Several weeks ago, Margaret OReilly began seeing a local psychiatrist in her city of Seattle Washington. Dr. Ahmed Abdullah Rahman is a licensed psychiatrist who originally practiced in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. He has been practicing psychiatric medicine in the US for more than 10 years. After one session, according to Mrs. OReilly, Dr. Rahman stunned her by suggesting that she was suffering from Disobedient Wife Disorder. The treatment for Disobedient Wife Disorder (or DWD), which is even more controversial, involves light beatings using a stick called a miswak. The punishment is administered by the womans husband, along with verbal admonitions from him for his wife to be obedient, or to end her rebellion. The practice is designed, allegedly, not to injure a woman or to harm her, but to shame and humiliate her into compliance. The controversial treatment is allegedly about Bringing the woman back to her senses and back to reality according to one booklet on the topic. Disobedient Wife Disorder remains a controversial diagnosis, sparking strong feelings among those on both sides of the issue. Most of the psychiatrists in the West who do accept the existence of DWD are Muslim, and this fact is often cited by Islamophobes and reactionaries. The American Psychiatric Association, as well as the American Psychological Association, both reject the diagnosis. When I began writing this article, Margaret OReilly was suing Dr. Rahman for medical malpractice. According to Mrs. OReilly I have always been progressive and strongly anti-racist.

He was rapidly transported to the hospital where he arrived in critical condition, but doctors were finally able to stabilize him after a few hours. Upon regaining consciousness, he admitted that he had tried everything to enlarge his penis over the last two years, and had already invested $15,000 in pills and penile pumps, without success. He finally decided to try his industrial air compressor, and he insists that his genitals did enlarge during the first few seconds before they literally exploded. I swear it couldve worked if Id left only a few seconds less Despite this partial success, he has now lost more than 90% of his genitals and may suffer from critical consequences for the rest of his life. This isnt the third accident involving makeshift penis enlargement devices this month in New Jersey, and authorities fear this could be the consequences of a new trend. Dr. Michael Hart, one of the most renowned penile surgeon in the world, says this kind of incident is bound to happen more often over the next few years as men become increasingly obsessed with the size of their genitals.

Gun store break-in VIDEO: Clarksville gun store owner says group stole 30 guns in Christmas Day break-in: http://bit.ly/2pO10xz CC: Double Tap Tactical Posted by WZTV FOX 17 News, Nashville on Thursday, December 28, 2017  The guns were valued at over $20,000. Fox 17 reports:  The thieves got away with 25 semi-automatic pistols, three revolvers and three rifles, all with brand names such as Glock, Smith & Wesson, Ruger, Walther, Taurus, Sig-Sauer, and several others. At this point now were trying to figure out who did this and where our guns are at, said Ron Berger, store owner. Berger is a military veteran who served in Iraq with the U.S. Army. He transitioned to civilian life, has a wife and three kids, and has owned Double Tap Tactical for five years. Berger had recently relocated his store and has not yet been insured. The new store is located in Clarksville, Tennessee. So moving forward from this point I dont know what direction were gonna go unless we get our firearms back, Berger said. ""Its not looking promising."" We gotta get these guns off the street, and we gotta get them back, Berger said. He did say that police had a lead in the case.",1
"Title: Blog: A remarkable provision of the omnibus bill  Article: Senator John McCain is leading the charge against language in the omnibus bill that allows the continued use of Russian rockets in our space launchings of U.S. military satellites. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain blasted colleagues for including language in the must-pass spending bill effectively allowing United Launch Alliance  a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin  to continue using Russian rocket engines to launch military satellites into space. The language in the bill mandates the competition be open to military space launch vehicle providers ""regardless of the country of origin of the rocket engine. ULA, which relies on Russian RD-180 rocket engines to power its Atlas V rocket, recently dropped out of the Air Force's GPS III Launch Services competition after the Pentagon refused to give the company some relief from the fiscal 2015 defense budget's ban on use of RD-180s for military satellite launches after 2019. But the new language sets the stage for ULA to re-enter the competition. It is a sad day in American history and that of NASA and other rocketry development efforts in the United States that we are outsourcing (to use an Obama term) our reliance on rocket propulsion. Much of this involves national security and military capabilities. Recall that it was this same president who reduced the capacity of NASA. In an American Thinker article from 2008, we received a recap of the curious and sudden budgetary concerns of Barack Obama. A president whose legacy is that under his administration, more aggregate federal debt has been accrued than all the previous administrations combined.",0
"Title: GE's Big Brother  Article: The Obama administration has come under scrutiny for its ties to several large corporations, including the auto industry giants General Motors and Chrysler, whose bailout it engineered last spring. But one corporate connection has not received similar scrutiny. Since 2008, General Electric has been cozying up to the Obama administration. The relationship is sure to result in financial gain for GE, while likely granting the company greater access and influence. The arrangements set forth are legal, but the potential impact the interconnections may have  and the blatant kickbacks that have been offered  should alarm Americans. In a Washington Examiner op-ed, journalist Timothy Carney points out the eyebrow-raising ties between President Barack Obama's team and GE's leadership. According to Carney, GE CEO Jeff Immelt sits on Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, and GE owns MSNBC, the network famously friendly to Obama. Immeltss place on the board is concerning for a number of reasons. First and foremost, GE has been the recipient of bailout funds and stands to benefit from current and future contracts with the U.S. government. This may partly explain MSNBCs highly favorable treatment of the Obama administration. With GEs CEO sitting on Obamas economic panel, it is no surprise that MSNBC rarely provides critical coverage of the administration. Furthermore, GEs environmental business interests may explain why NBC recently joined Hollywood in inserting environmentally-friendly messaging into network programming.",0
"Title: Visualizing The Illegal Drone Bombardment: Tweeting Every Known US Strike Takes Student Over 12 Hours  Article: White House Wont Acknowledge Program Even Exists Steve Watson Prisonplanet.com Dec 12, 2012 A student compiled information and links to news reports and documents on every known US drone strike within the last ten years and decided to tweet about every one. Initially he believed the task would take ten minutes to complete. However, over 12 HOURS later he was still tweeting. Im going to tweet the entire history of US drone strikes tomorrow. 10 years in 10 minutes, starting at 12pm. Follow @dronestream for more. Josh Begley (@joshbegley) December 11, 2012 As part of his graduate project, NYU student Josh Begley opened the Twitter account @dronestream, and began tweeting his research Tuesday. At first, I wanted to visualize frequency  to see if I could tweet 10 years in 10 minutes, Begley told the London Guardian. Clearly that didnt work out. After tweeting for 12 hours Ive only reached 2010, and as many folks will tell you, the strikes only pick up from there. The first officially recorded CIA drone strikes took place in 2002 under the Bush administration, since then they have escalated dramatically, particularly since Barak Obama entered the White House in 2008. In his first four years in office, Obama authorized six times more drone strikes in Pakistan than under all eight years of the Bush Administration. Begley compiled the information by scouring records from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.",0
"Title: 9/11: Never Forget Project  Article: The 17th anniversary of September 11, 2001 is upon us and the Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) at Ripon College had been planning a 9/11 project. Evidently, the schools Bias Protocol Board is not too enthused over it. YAFs 9/11: Never Forget Project, which began 15 years ago, consists of 2,977 flags representing each life that was extinguished on that day of infamy, as well as a poster featuring multiple images and photographs of the Islamic terrorists who murdered them. According to YAF, its members were informed that the project, particularly the poster, is objectionable because it relentlessly targets one religious organization, one religious group, one religious identity [.] As such, it gives rise to an environment within which students from a Muslim background would feel singled out and/or harassed. A spokesperson from Ripon said that school officials merely offered student representatives of YAF suggestions as to how to have a discussion about 9/11 this year with our entire campus and community (emphasis mine). Presumably, YAFs project as such is insufficiently inclusive. Of course, the idea that there is something Islamophobic about remembering 9/11, or about doing so with explicit reference to the Islamic terrorists who were responsible for it, has been circulating for quite some time. Three years ago, for example, The Daily Beasthardly a conservative or right-wing publicationconfirmed that students at the University of Minnesota killed a proposed moment of silence for 9/11 victims due to concernsthat Muslim students would be offended. To its credit, the author of the Beast essay recognizes these concerns as insulting and childish.",1

Spence-Jones, whos arranged some sweeeet downtown land deals for wealthy contributors, at first proposed an ordinance to require police permits to gather on public property. Then she visited Umoja. Several times, it turns out.

"Title: Dont Believe Our Planet is Warming Up? Look At This!  Article: Many people, for some reason, refuse to believe that climate change is a real thing. With evidence mounting, we all need to get on the same page. Meteorologists in England began collecting weather statistics back in 1659 but it wasnt until 1873 that countries began sharing annual data through what is now known as the World Meteorological Organization. This is why officially the global record doesnt begin until 1880. The year 2016 was our hottest year since we began recording with average global land and water surface temperatures hitting 58.69 degrees Fahrenheit. That is around 2.69 degrees warmer than the twentieths century average. All but one of the sixteen hottest years in NASAs 134-year record have occurred since the year 2000. While this difference may not seem like much to most but it is. Records show that changes of this magnitude do not happen over a mere century leaving human fingerprints all over the temperature trend. Industry, as you know, boomed in the late 1800s sending new pollutants into the air. As a result of this carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have multiplied and are continuing to do so even today. Global warming is like riding up an escalator. Sure, these temperatures rise and fall but climate change is pushing the skyward no matter what. In the chart below you will see the numbers of years per decade that had above average temperature and how many of those years rose a half or whole degree above what was normal. You do not need a science degree to see that the average global temperature is rising. Our hottest years are getting hotter and something needs to be done.",0
"Title: Catholic Bishops Love Mexico  Article: Americas Catholic bishops have asked all Americans to call Congress today, Monday, February 26, to demand amnesty for millions of illegal aliens. In a bishops-only letter of February 16, leaders of the national bishops conference urge their fellow bishops to ramp up their efforts because the urgency of this matter is now at its height. This is the most ambitious political campaign the bishops have launched in years. Whats going on? First, Catholic bishops like Mexico. Los Angeles Archbishop Jos Gmez is a leader in the bishops amnesty campaign. Born in Monterrey, he knows Mexico well. Like tens of millions of Mexican-Americans, he is still eligible to vote in Mexicos elections. But he wants millions of Mexican citizens now in the U.S. to be eligible to vote in our own elections as well. Why? Well, Gmez insists that Mexican immigrants have strong traditions of family and faith, community and hard work. Moreover, most are Catholic and hold deep conservative values. Thats why Gmez and his brother bishops oppose assimilation of Hispanics into broader American society. After all, bishops consider that society to be full of nativists, racists, xenophobes, and bigots. Assimilate? Why not just wait? After all, once some thirty to forty million more Hispanics become American citizens, he says, I know that together we will build an America that is stronger, more religious, and more moral. Of course, millions of new Hispanic Catholics will also fill the pews emptied by millions of Americas cradle Catholics who have left the Church during the past fifty years.",0
"Title: The White Man Won  Article: >Hey, Obama is half white, after all. We call him black, but the fact is, hes just as white as he is black, genetically speaking. Which is perfect. Some people think Abraham Lincoln had some African blood in him. Whether or not he did, two skinny tall guys from Illinois, both lawyers and state legislators, both coming from humble beginnings, went on to reach the presidency of the United States of America. The first one freed the black slaves, the second became the first black president. Though he is half white, we call him black. And yet we elected him, overwhelmingly. And, while that is certainly a victory for the black man in America, it is also a victory for the white man in America. For the simple reason that he has overcome his sordid history of racism. In that sense, it is a victory for us all. Even the racists that are presently seething in their hatred as they witness a history they never saw coming may eventually be changed. Why? Because, familiarity brings understanding. Although Mr. & Ms. Bigot may not see it today, eventually, they will have to admit that, hey, this guy is doing a pretty good job. (Because we know hell do a great job.) And theyll see him everyday in the news, conducting their nations business. The country will not turn communist. Obama will not invite Al Qaeda for dinner. They sky will not fall. They will, eventually, see that they were lied to, by their own party this man is no terrorist, he is a true, red, white and blue American. And like the prejudiced person living in a formerly all-white neighborhood, when the black family moves in next door, after some time passes and they get to know them a bit, the prejudice subsides.",0
"Title: The Fall of the Ottomans  Article: The Fall of the Ottomans: The Great War in the Middle East, by Eugene Rogan  In this book, Eugene Rogan tells the story of the Great War in the Middle East  not from the side of the Great Powers, but from the side of the Ottomans. He begins with the story of his great-uncle, Lance Corporal John McDonald. His great-uncle was born in a small Scottish village. Along with his friend, Charles Beveridge, McDonald enlisted with the 8th Scottish Rifles (the Cameronians) when war broke out. They said farewell to friends and family on 17 May 1915, headed to the eastern Mediterranean. They arrived at the Greek island of Lemnos, the staging post for British and Allied forces, on 29 May  one month after the fighting on Gallipoli had broken out. By mid-June they sailed onward to the peninsula. Passing some who had returned from the fighting, the fresh-faced recruits would shout out: Are we downhearted? No! In reply, some Australian wag shouted back, Well you damned soon will be. The Fall of the Ottoma... Eugene Rogan Best Price: $3.50 Buy New $9.90 (as of 02:10 EDT - Details)  On 14 June, the battalion was safely ashore, and four days later they were headed up Gully Ravine to the fighting. On 28 June, following two hours of bombardment from the sea, the 8th Scottish Rifles came out of their trenches and attacked. Within five minutes, they were wiped out. McDonald died in the camp hospital; the body of his friend Beveridge was never found, assumed to be in the unidentifiable conglomeration of remains buried in a mass grave only after the war. The author, Rogan, went to Gallipoli in 2005 to see firsthand this place of infamy  and the site of his great-uncles death.",0

Most people add a little bit to the top of their salad when they remember but thats about it. There are so many health benefits from apple cider vinegar that I recommend taking it routinely almost as if its a supplement. Why? well lets take a look at just 6 reasons why you should 1. It Maintains an active Metabolism 2. It maintains an active protein metabolism  This helps the body repair and recover, protein is usable. 3. It Boosts Human Growth Hormone (HGH) (Because Available Protein is a building block for HGH) 4.

It helps produce insulin which converts glucose into energy 6. Some of the acids help to produce tryptophan and serotonin, benefiting sleep and overall feeling of well-being. Heres a video that describes these in more detail: Apple cider vinegar has so many benefits, but personally one of the reasons I like it best is because of the digestive and metabolism boosting benefits. It is probably the cheapest way to improve your metabolism (others would be drinking more water and incorporating organic lemons and limes) that I know of.",0
"Title: Retired bishop reposts scathing commentary on Boston gay pride Mass (corrected)  Article: NewsFaith, Homosexuality This article has been CORRECTED to name Joe Sacerdo as the author of the original commentary, not Bishop Gracida, who had reposted the commentary on his blog. We sincerely apologize for the error. CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas, June 22, 2011 (LifeSiteNews.com) - Corpus Christis outspokenly conservative retired Catholic bishop has re-posted a strong commentary against the scandal surrounding Bostons gay pride Mass scheduled for next month, in which the author calls it a travesty that the archdiocese would countenance the event. Bishop Ren Henry Gracida on his blog Tuesday posted an article by pseudonymous blogger Joe Sacerdo, of the conservative Catholic blog Bryan Hehir Exposed, discussing the event originally planned by the Rainbow Ministry of St. Cecilias Parish to coincide with Bostons gay pride month, before it was cancelled by the Archdiocese of Boston. Gay rights supporters in the parish were only partially mollified when the archdiocese clarified that the Mass, themed All Are Welcome, was being rescheduled for July 10. The diocese had said it was worried that the original date gave the unintended impression that the Mass was meant to celebrate gay pride month. However, the original statement in the church bulletin announcing the Mass had explicitly invited all friends and supporters of the LGBT community to a Mass in celebration of Bostons Pride Month. Echoing the sentiments of local pro-family Catholic leaders, Sacerdo concluded, Its pretty bad in Boston. So, unless Im mistaken, Cardinal Sean OMalley, Bishop Robert Hennessey, [archdiocesan spokesman] Terry Donilon, Fr.",0
"Title: GOP speaker on Moore accusers: Fabrication, falsehood and forgery  Article: The sexual misconduct allegations against Senate candidate Roy Moore are little more than scurrilous attacks emanating from forces within the national media and political establishments intent on robbing Alabama conservatives of influence in the coming special election. That was the heart of an impassioned message delivered by Janet Porter, president of the conservative Faith2Action network, at a Republican Party event in Cullman, Ala., Saturday. In Alabama, Porter is an outsider herself but the Ohio resident told the crowd she visited the state to stump for Moore because she believes his values align best with conservatives throughout the country. I came to Alabama  because this is ground zero in the culture war for where were going to go in the United States of America, she said. The Alabama election, she added, has implications for conservatives far beyond the states borders. This Senate race is winner take all, Porter added, noting that a Moore loss means big hurdles for a conservative agenda already imperiled by a razer thin margin in the Senate. The Moore supporter explained that losing the Senate seat up for grabs will make it harder for the Trump administration to achieve conformation for key appointments for the remainder of the presidents term. That, according to the speaker, is especially important with regard to the Supreme Court, where many conservatives believe President Donald Trump has his best opportunity to solidify a conservative legacy.",0
"Title: NYC MAYOR DE BLASIO Blasted by Queens WomanHe Runs Away! [Video]  Article: Vickie Paladino and her husband were driving through their neighborhood when they spotted the mayor. Paladino was so upset over de Blasios trip to Germany to speak at a G-20 protest in lieu of attending a vigil for slain New York police officer Miosotis Familia that she left the car to berate him. As de Blasio approached her and a group of others to shake hands, she started to ask about his trip. He turned around with his security detail and went to his car. I want to know why you let your police officers down and our country down by going to Germany and protesting against our country, she yelled at de Blasio. I want to know why youre doing that. OK? I dont care about the trees. Well work it out. CBS reporter Marcia Kramer had a scathing assessment of de Blasio, who she said simply fled when Paladino started her criticism. The woman in the white shirt single-handedly brought WrestleMania to the streets of Whitestone, Queens, but her opponent Bill de Blasio was no Hulk Hogan or The Rock, Kramer said. He was more like the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard Of Oz. Paladino caught the attention of the media assembled for the event, and she told reporters that shed had it with de Blasio and doubted he had a friend in the city. This is got to do with a liberal, socialist mayor who is running our city and has no regard for our country, she said. Why did you go to Germany?",1

"Title: New York City jihad bomber gets multiple life sentences for blast that injured 30  Article: Even today, he appears to remain steadfast in that commitment and has shown no remorse. The defendants communications while incarcerated further demonstrate that, far from appreciating the depravity of his actions, he is proud of what he did, scornful of the American justice system, and as dedicated as ever to his terrorist ideology. And while he is in prison, even if it is for the rest of his life, what will be done to disabuse him of that terrorist ideology? Nothing. In fact, U.S. prison officials will do everything they can to reinforce it. The U.S. prison system, like the military and more, is committed to the proposition that Islam is a religion of peace, and that its practice is to be encouraged. Confronted with someone like Rahimi who tried to murder people in the name of Islam and in accord with its teachings, they give him a prison life that is filled only with reinforcement of the ideology that landed him in prison in the first place: prayers with other inmates, the Quran supplied and treated with the utmost respect, etc. ""Chelsea bomber gets multiple life prison sentences for New York blast that injured 30, by Travis Fedschun, Fox News, February 13, 2018:  The convicted terrorist who planted two pressure-cooker bombs on New York City streets  including one that injured 30 people with a rain of shrapnel when it detonated  was sentenced Tuesday to multiple life terms in prison.

Oh, wait, that hasn't happened. Why hasn't that happened? Unlike the leftist, liberal, progressive, intolerant for everything American loony toons, law-abiding citizens and constitutionalists believe in the rule of law meaning unruly riotous street protests across the nation are seen as the wrong method to affect change. Despite the leftist, liberal, progressive, intolerant population's use of these tactics to undermine the rule of law and advance political ideology anathema to our Constitution, law-abiding citizens understand these tactics would not work in the current political climate where law is what the Democrat Party of Hussein Soetoro and Hillary Clinton decide it to be at the time.

"Title: Even fake news is vital to our liberty  Article: Part 2 of 2. Read the first part, 1st Amendment written to protect fake news  Although the term fake news was not part of their lexicon, the Founding Fathers understood quite well the concept. As I discussed last week in 1st Amendment was written to protect fake news, highly partisan editors used the power of their presses to disseminate their views with little concern over whether they were being truthful or even upheld basic standards of decorum. Newspapers, pamphlets and broadsheets provided nourishment to both spark the American Revolution and keep it alive. Doubtless King George thought the ongoing lists of grievances colonial editors proclaimed against the crown were at best overblown if not outright lies. As Ken Burns notes in his book , Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and The Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism:  Certainly the war would not have begun as soon as it did without the encouragement of the press. As New York Journal editor John Holt said on one occasion to Sam Adams, It was by means of News papers that we receivd & spread the Notice of the tyrannical Designs formed against America, and kindled a Spirit that has been sufficient to repel them. And almost certainly, the war would not have ended with an American victory in a period of seven years from the first shot to signed treaty had not the newspapers  and some pamphlets  constantly reminded the colonists of the cause they shared, thereby inspiring the valor of soldiers and the patience and support of civilians.

"Title: Ex-UK PM on Obama: ""Narcissistic and Self-absorbed""  Article: Maybe some of those shrinks who suddenly got busy remotely psychoanalyzing Trump can spare a moment for their Beloved Leader? David Cameron thought Barack Obama was one of the 'most narcissistic, self-absorbed people' he had ever dealt with, his former strategy guru has claimed. Steve Hilton tore into Mr Obama for thinking he was 'smarter' than everyone else in the room and he claimed that his old boss Mr Cameron would get wound up by the ex President's self absorption. The former Downing Street adviser was highly critical of Mr Obama and said: 'My old boss, former British prime minister David Cameron, thought Obama was one of the most narcissistic, self-absorbed people he'd ever dealt with. 'Obama never listened to anyone, always thought he was smarter than every expert in the room, and treated every meeting as an opportunity to lecture everyone else. 'This led to real-world disasters, like Syria and the rise of Isis.' Cameron is denying this, inevitably. Obama still does have his cult of personality. But it's not hard to find examples of Obama boasting about his superiority to his own staff. And toward the end relations turned quite ugly as Obama tried to blame the UK for Syria. There hasn't been a single honest media assessment of the dysfunctional administration and its incoherent foreign policy. Instead we've been showered with vague adjectives about Obama's genius even as Iran burns. There's been no serious discussions about why Obama couldn't keep a Secretary of Defense, why the planning for ObamaCare was so poor and what happened in Syria. Instead we get flattery.

"Title: Viking settlement 'Hop' is in New Brunswick, claims archaeologist  Article: A long lost Viking settlement known as 'Hop' is located in Canada, a prominent archaeologist has revealed. Seafaring Scandinavians built a settlement in North America more than 1,000 years ago, 500 years before Christopher Columbus, it is claimed. Three key things identify this mystical settlement - an abundance of grapes, salmon and canoes made from animal hide - according to legend. Now, one expert claims the only place that matches this description is the Miramichi-Chaleur bay area in northeastern New Brunswick in Canada. This would be the third Viking settlement claimed to have been found in North America, although it could be hard to conclusively prove the new theory. Scroll down for video  A lost viking settlement known as 'Hop' that was home to wild grapes and canoes from animal hides has been finally located, a prominent archaeologist has claimed (stock image)  Dr Birgitta Wallace, a senior archaeologist emerita with Parks Canada told Live Science that the illusive Hop may have referred to several seasonal settlements. In theories spanning several decades, researchers have suggested it could have been located in Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New York - among other places. Dr Wallace has pinpointed the location using descriptions from Viking voyages as well as archaeological work carried out at L'Anse aux Meadows, which was the first Viking settlement found in North America in the 1960s. The second, a site built between 800AD and 1300AD that was uncovered in Newfoundland in 2016, is the second, though scientists are yet to confirm it is of Viking origin.",0
"Title: Occult Inc: Artist Azealia Banks Releases Disgusting Vid + Geldof Daughters Satanic Sex Cult  Article: By 21st Century Wire says The business of selling satanic and occult concepts has proved to be a lucrative one  thanks to the music industry. One of the fundamental problems with the corporate entertainment industry is that through its big budget marketing and paid-for media reach, its able to exert undo influence over its target market of teens and pre-teen children with its overt promotion of occult symbols and imagery. The balance of influence is overwhelmingly tipped in favour of a handful of media multinationals, and these are the results This latest monstrosity by their latest willing agitprop front girl, artist Azealia Banks, is probably one of the most in-your-face examples of what the entertainment industrys mission currently is: a cultural psy-op which is pressing ahead with the simultaneous program to proliferate satanic imagery and symbolism together with the increased sexualisation of young people and the promotion of paedophilia. The idea behind this media-wide program is to make all these things appear as acceptable, or the new normal. They have more of less succeeded in capturing an entire generation. The political and legal agenda being pushed by this tight-knit ring of interest is to lower the age of consent  or in other words, to legalise sex with ever younger children, opening new markets for predators and their most lucrative enterprise prostitution.",1

That is a national movement started by charter companies to organize parents to take over their schools. That is quite a risky business in my opinion since those groups of parents actually want to turn the public schools into charter schools. I fear it will cause a school to cave in to parents who are not educators, who are not informed as to effective teaching skills, and who might be using such an effort to avoid responsibility for their children as students. They are being manipulated by the billionaire education reformers. The cast and the backers: Is Education Reform Hollywood Box Office Gold? How far teachers have fallen since the Lean on Me days.Due to be released in September, Wont Back Down stars Viola Davis as a Pennsylvania teacher who joins with unexpected parent advocate Maggie Gyllenhaal in the push for a parent takeover of their school. Apparently the story hinges on so-call parent trigger laws, which allow parents to turn public schools into publicly funded charter schools if they can prove the teachers, administrators and curriculum are not serving the students. In real life, a handful of states have parent trigger laws on the books. To date, no trigger laws have turned a school over to parents, though today officials will decide whether to allow for just that at a desert school in Adelanto, Calif. Parent trigger laws have many big corporate backers, including the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation.",0
"Title: UPDATE-I'm the ""bottle-thrower"" Mayor Quan, your legal adviser knows it, go ahead & arrest me again.  Article: Ironies abound in the real world. From Quan's Wiki Page ""Siegel had been considered a controversial figure at City Hall due to his supposed vocal criticism of Oakland Police...."" ---------------------------------- ""Her legal adviser opposed the police action and threatened to resign."" That's from after the police riot on the 99%. That's the Dan Siegel I knew. A different one visited the Occupy Oakland after the police riots. Siegel said he came to offer support but as he walked into the plaza he was confronted by a man who called him a fraud for representing Quan...""This guy has no credibility, another man shouted. Youre a hack. You have already lost. What are you doing here? Get out of the way. A woman handed Siegel a penny. ""This is you,"" she said. ""You are the 1 percent. "" Well, I'm so down on Quan now I couldn't even begin to tell you. First, she congratulates the police after THEIR riot of overwhelming (& planned a week in advance) force. Then she records a subsequent apology to us. That shouts at the very least, of the Romneyism of a politician long lost to working ""inside"" the system. You know, the system that swallows you when you are inside it trying to change it. The recall is the way to go. I'll keep believing that until (& if) I see her standing between protestors & the police at the Oakland docks (portion thereof wherein Goldman Sach's possesses 50% ownership) Nov 2, & not in the background whispering in the PD's ears to squash dissent. Dan Siegel. That's a different story. It is personally painful to see him brought so low due to his association with Quan. I hope he follows through on his musings & resigns soon. I think he will.",0
"Title: Steve Bannon Is Stepping Down From Breitbart  Article: Just days after President Trump snubbed an olive branch offered by his former chief strategist and putative ""alter-ego"", the New York Times is reporting that Steve Bannon - the ""alt-right"" icon and former Trump campaign manager - is stepping down from his position as executive chairman of Breitbart News. Trump blasted Bannon in a public statement last week, saying the former senior White House official and - briefly - member of the National Security Council - ""lost his mind"" after Trump fired him. Bannon and the president had an abrupt falling out last week after excerpts from Michael Wolff's controversial book ""Fire And Fury"" - his account of the first year of the Trump administration - revealed Bannon making several embarrassing on-the-record statements. In one, he said Don. Jr.'s decision to organize the Russia meeting was ""treasonous"", and that President Trump definitely knew about the meeting. In another, he reportedly told Wolff that the possibility of removing Trump via the 25th amendment is discussed daily in the West Wing. Breitbart published a terse statement about Bannon's departure on its website. It was stocked with several wooden platitudes from CEO Larry Solov: Stephen K. Bannon has stepped down from Breitbart News Network, where he served as Executive Chairman since 2012. Bannon and Breitbart will work together on a smooth and orderly transition. Bannon said, Im proud of what the Breitbart team has accomplished in so short a period of time in building out a world-class news platform.",0

"Title: Mysterious elongated Skull discovered in Russia recreated in 3D  Article: Russian archaeologists have managed to recreate a computer model of the enigmatic elongated skull that was discovered in Russias Stonehenge: Arkaim. This proves that elongated skulls are a global phenomenon present all around the world. The question that remains is: Why were elongated skulls so important in the distant past? In 2015, Russian archaeologists excavating Russias Stonehenge known as Arkaim discovered a mysterious skeleton with an unusually anomalous elongated skull. After numerous studies and analysis, they have managed to recreate how the Arkaim elongated skull really looked like in the distant past. Arkaim is one of the most mysterious ancient archaeological sites in Russia. This 20.000 square meter compound was protected by circular walls just before it was burned down and abandoned mysteriously. Archaeologists believe that, just like Stonehenge in the UK, Arkaim was an ancient site dedicated to the observation of stars and constellations. Arkaim was a very sophisticated settlement, and in some cases, it displayed unique technologies that went far beyond the capabilities of other similar settlements since Arkaim had a very complex water drainage system and sedimentation pits. Researchers speculate that ancient tribes in the vicinity of Arkaim practiced head binding just as many other ancient cultures around the globe. Researcher Maria Makurova has confirmed to the Russian news agency TASS: We have found a well-preserved skeleton. Her skull was elongated because the tribe did so by tying up the heads of their children with rope.",0
"Title: Have the Democrats Introduced an Immigration Overton Window Scenario?  Article: Conservatives constantly complain about a lack of transparency in Washington, and for good reason. Just look at the Mueller investigation, the FBI and FISA. But on at least one issue, things are as transparent as they can be. This issue is immigration and the transparency is John McCain's white-hot hatred of Donald Trump. McCain will not miss a single opportunity to stick a finger in the eye of Trump, regardless of the damage to his Party and especially the nation. And so it is yet again as the great Maverick of the Senate, John McCain, joined forces with demDemocratris Coons to introduce their own bipartisan immigration proposal. Bipartisan is supposed to mean working together and compromising, when needed, for the good of the whole. Yet we should know by now, bipartisan in Washington bears no resemblance to the real world. D.C. bipartisanship means only that Republicans cave to the immediate demands of democrats, trusting the untrustworthy dems to follow through with whatever vague promise they make of maybe giving the right a little of what they want later. And we also know that later never comes. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) formally introduced a bill that would grant permanent legal status to undocumented immigrants known as dreamers and start bolstering security along the U.S.-Mexico border. But the measure would not immediately authorize spending the $25 billion President Trump is seeking to fortify the border with new wall and fence construction, writes the Washington Post, and I'm sure gleefully so.",1
"Title: Ex MI6 Spy Who Compiled Golden Showers Report Was FBI Source for FIFA Scandal  Article: The man behind the unsubstantiated Golden Showers report on President-elect Donald Trumps supposed ties to Russia is a former officer in Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), and was the FBIs source in the FIFA corruption scandal. The operative, identified as Christopher Steele by the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, is a former Russian operations officer for Britains MI6 intelligence agency, Reuters reported. After leaving M16, Steele worked with the FBI, providing intelligence on the world soccer associations ties to suspected Russian gangsters. Steele had originally been hired to investigate Trump by political opponents within the Democratic and Republican parties, but it has not been revealed exactly who hired him. He then decided to share the dossier with the FBI, who took it seriously, despite the far-fetched allegations, due to his previous work on the FIFA case. Hes a meticulous professional, and there are no questions about his integrity, a US official who has worked with Steele told Reuters. The information he provided me [about Russia] was valuable and useful. The allegations in the report have been dismissed by both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and even Buzzfeed, who initially published the report, noted discrepancies and acknowledged that nothing in the dossier could be confirmed. Trump has referred to the report as a political witch hunt and phony, fake news. Incoming White House Press Secretary and Communications Director Sean Spicer called Buzzfeeds decision to release the report without confirming any of the allegations shameful and disgraceful, during a news conference on Wednesday.",1
"Title: OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro Stands as Democracys Most Courageous Defender in the Region  Article: The Organization of American States (OAS) recently commemorated the 15th anniversary of the organizations democratic charter. In the decade and a half since its founding, the charter and its spirit have been desecrated and mocked. The flourishing of elected dictatorships of the left, since the late 1990s, was met with indifference and moral shallowness as political opponents were imprisoned, judiciaries were bulldozed by despots, journalists were persecuted, and society as a whole was intimidated by the authorities. For almost two decades the OAS has been nothing but a club of presidents all ignoring violations of democracy and human rights in the name of regional integration. Such integration was supposed to create a powerful economic and political Latin American block. Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, and other countries that openly violated human rights were very much part of this project and as regional allies they could not be alienated. Therefore, the idea promoted by countries such as Brazil and other democracies was to say that the principle of sovereignty and respect for each countries internal affairs had priority over the application of the OAS charter. Thus, Inter-American protection of democracy was seen as an outrageous intervention that violated national rights, instead of being seen as a tool to protect universal values of freedom and human dignity. This view was also supported by the former OAS Secretary General, Jose Miguel Insulza. It is obvious that the Inter-American democratic charter by virtue of being a set of international laws, and not national laws, implies that there is an element of interference in internal affairs.",0

"Title: LGBT victory in Canada, government allows third gender option on passports  Article: NewsGender OTTAWA, August 29, 2017 (LifeSiteNews)  Canadas Liberal government has cleared the way for Canadians who dont want to identify as either male or female to opt for an X on their passport. Pro-family advocates decry the move as further entrenching the false ideology of gender fluidity. This is so harmful, says Jack Fonseca, senior political strategist with Campaign Life Coalition. The government trying to force its citizenry, en masse, to deny scientific fact and biological reality. Fonseca says the move is dangerous for children who are at risk of sexual confusion by the further societal normalization of transgenderism. Canadians are harmed by unwittingly but systematically being trained to deny the evidence of their own eyes, he told LifeSiteNews in an email. And it will hurt people suffering with the mental illness of gender dysphoria by corroborating the illusion they can alter their sex. Meanwhile, transgender activists complain this doesnt go far enough, and that the provinces are dragging behind their federal counterpart.

"Title: New Left Thinkers: Pursuing Utopia or Annihilation?  Article: How did we arrive at a world where the New York Times and other prominent mass media extol leaders of the brutal North Korean regime at the Olympics? The answer is that our current mainstream journalists and educational establishment are largely the ideological offspring of the European and American thinkers of the New Left. Thanks to Roger Scrutons book Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left, I can now better understand my own experiences of contemporary academia. Until fifteen years ago I devoted a lot of effort to promoting critical thinking in higher education in Japan and Asia. Then I came up against widespread resistance among academics to the inculcation of rationality and eventually gave up on many of those efforts, mystified by the current ascendency of relativistic thinking in the university world. Even more puzzling has been the emergence of Marxist thought among evangelical intellectuals like Tim Keller. A conservative British philosopher and prolific writer, Roger Scruton does a superb job of explaining how this state of affairs came about. He probes the writings of many influential European and American New Left thinkers, such as Sartre, Said, Foucault, Adorno, Derrida, Rorty, and Zizek. Rather than trying to cover his analysis of these writers in detail, this review will bring out some prominent themes of the whole book that impressed me, including some representative quotes. To begin with, the New Left thinkers clearly revealed their hostility to ordinary people and their traditions. Like the older Marxists before them, they demonized the bourgeoisie, which basically means middle-class people.",1

"Title: Idea for the DK: Adopt a senator campaign.  Article: So my idea is a DKos campaign: Adopt a senator. This would certainly be for those of us who are in fairly safe blue areas, with reps very likely to be re-elected. But also for those who can take on more than a race or two at a time. I imagine the effort starting with a list of vulnerable democratic senate seats, as well as a list of democratic senatorial candidates running against incumbent republican senators. We put that out, and ask for adopters. The role of adopters would be to give money and time where they can. Hopefully, we might be able to have a running feature on this, with feed back from adopters telling us what they're doing for their new ""baby."" I want to note here, that if all anyone could give was a bit of money, that would be great. The idea is not to make the adopter feel weighed down by the responsibility. The idea is to put a chorus of angels behind our vulnerable democratic senators, and our democratic candidates that could do anything from donating, to phone canvassing, to getting to know that district and dropping good links in the appropriate places, or signing relevant petitions. Maybe the most you do as an adopter is show up on line on the pertinent sites and cheer lead. To each their own as to what they can give. I also wonder if the Dkos could partner with another progressive outlet, such as moveon or the Color of Change, to name just two, in promoting this campaign. I must be honest to say, I don't have the computer savvy to pull this off on my own, and I don't have the time to do so either.",0
"Title: George W. Bush Ordered to Testify Under Oath  Article: Link to AP article Gary Vodicka, a lawyer who lived in a condominium complex across the street from Southern Methodist University, has sued the university regarding how it obtained the land where the Bush library will be - where his home once stood. The lawsuit centers on SMU's acquisition of University Gardens, a run-down, 40-year-old condominium complex across the street from the university. SMU decided at the end of 1998 to begin buying up the approximately 350 units. Through a realty company called Peruna  the name of the college's mascot  SMU bought enough units to gain a majority of seats on the board of the homeowners association. It filled those seats with SMU employees and others affiliated with the university who did not own units or live at the complex. Basically, the university used underhanded tactics to gain control of the condominiums. They eventually bought everyone out, save Vodicka and another individual. Citing problems with asbestos, the roof, mold and sewer lines, the school bulldozed the condos in 2006. Later that year, it became apparent SMU would be the site of Bush's library. The land upon which the condos once sat will be part of the library grounds. Both sides agree on that much. They disagree on whether the school lied about its intentions and breached its legal duty to the other condo owners by letting the place fall into disrepair so that it could be torn down. Seems like a fair-enough complaint.",0
"Title: 'War Crime': Ex-US Army Officer Slams Pentagon's Alleged Arms Supplies to Syria  Article: The reported US supplies of Soviet-era munitions to Syrian rebels not only ""openly violates"" legal norms against financing terrorism, but also risks igniting a greater conflict across the Middle East, Scott Bennett, former US Army psychological operations officer and State Department counterterrorism contractor, told Sputnik. Untraceable Weapons Earlier, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) revealed in a report that Washington is allegedly running a $2.2 billion Soviet-era weapons pipeline for Syrian rebels. The Pentagon is reportedly working with contractors and subcontractors in Eastern Europe and the post-Soviet bloc. The munitions are being delivered to US allied forces in northern and southern Syria. The Pentagon is providing Syrian rebels with Soviet-era weapons because ""they are essentially untraceable, have an endless shelf life, and are also a financial currency that can be used to continue all conflicts,"" Bennett pointed out. Moreover, according to him, this fact is no surprise since it has been a ""standard tactic of US diplomatic war strategy for decades and used against numerous countries over the past 70 years"" in different parts of the world. Despite the fact that the Pentagon has denied the claims, Bennett argued that the report ""should be used as an exhibit in a UN International Criminal Court indictment against the US for both war crimes and crimes against humanity.",0
"Title: More women than ever are freezing their eggs while waiting for Mr. Right  Article: NewsBioethics LEICESTER, England, September 13, 2016 (LifeSiteNews)  Statistics show that women are delaying both marriage and having children, with a rapidly increasing number of women freezing their own eggs in hopes of having baby in the intentionally distant future. There are a variety of reasons for this in modern times, led by the ""climb the career ladder"" feminist culture that downplays domesticity and devalues motherhood. But The Daily Mail has found that the reason more women are freezing their eggs is because they haven't found the right father for their children-to-be. Researcher Kylie Baldwin, a Ph.D student at De Montfort University, surveyed 31 women who have frozen their ova and discovered the women are actually waiting for a ""hands-on"" father. ""It was the absence of this particular type of potential father, not just the absence of any partner, that led them to freeze the eggs,"" she told The Daily Mail. ""It's about having the right dad for their child. "" ""None of the women underwent the procedure for career reasons,"" Baldwin explained. Instead, many aggressively pursued their career precisely because they had not found a fatherly man who was as committed to parenthood as they wanted him to be. Several women surveyed were in relationships with partners that satisfied them personally but weren't ""father material,"" so they froze their eggs while remaining in the sexually satisfying relationship in the hope that a better man would enter their lives. Freezing ova for later fertilization was first offered to cancer patients whose treatment caused permanent sterility to allow them to have children after treatment.",0

"Title: Germany: Terror Cases Quadruple to 900  Article: There is an argument to be made that Obama's Arab Spring, with all its resulting consequences, including the various wars and civil wars, broke Europe. Whether that accelerated path to a civilizational conflict actually serves as a wake up call or a closing bell is still up in the air. But Europe, as I have discussed previously, is quickly stumbling into a war that it isn't prepared for. It's bad in France. It's bad in the UK. And Germany has hit its own speed bump with Frau Merkel at the wheel. The number of terrorism-related cases investigated by German authorities have quadrupled over the past year, newspaper Welt am Sonntag revealed Sunday. Prosecutors have opened more than 900 cases so far this year, compared to 240 throughout 2016. Just 80 cases related to terrorism reached the courts in 2013. The federal prosecutors office cant keep up with the increase and nearly 300 cases have been transferred to the state level. Not all cases involve plans to carry out attacks. Migrants from Syran, Iraq and Afghanistan have been tried over alleged membership in terror groups without being suspected of planning attacks on European soil. Germanys federal police (BKA) estimates 705 Islamist extremists are willing to carry out terror attacks, up from 600 during an estimate in February. That's far too many for German law enforcement to cope with. Terror cases have outpaced the resources of a number of European countries. And they're pushing our limits in America. Comey stated that there were around 2,000 terrorism investigations. 1,000 of those came from home grown violent extremism with no evidence of contact with foreign terrorists.",1
"Title: Mix It Up Prom Acclaimed As Huge Success  Article: By Julia Stanton At Progressive Valley Elementary School in Montgomery Washington, the summer school held its first Mix It Up Prom. Traditionally summer schools have not had proms, however progressive educators and activists decided to organize an especially meaningful one. What made this prom unique is that it encouraged students to look outside of their narrow racial or sexual orientation box and to take a step into a much larger and more diverse world. The Mix it up Prom encouraged white girls to go with African-American boys, and white boys to go with other boys. For many young men, it provided their first opportunity to begin to experiment with same-sex dating. For many young ladies, the event served to help them begin several especially meaningful relationships with young men of another race. This type of dating is absolutely necessary if we are to move forward into the next century, and if the United States is to become a full participant in the global community. Diverse relationships, whether they cross racial lines or sexual orientation lines are key to combating stereotypes, prejudice, and racial or sexual hatred. For that reason, some progressives have suggested mandating interracial marriage by law, in order to ensure that within just a few generations all Americans are of the same race, and the problem of racial prejudice is destroyed forever. Moderate progressives have suggested that whites simply should not have children at all, in order to help end racism, and should adopt babies from Africa instead.",1
"Title: Gay Marriage Ruling Hasnt Dissuaded Conservatives  Article: Californians have seen it before. From the overturn of voter approved Proposition 8 and Proposition 22 to this weeks U.S. Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges to institute homosexual marriage in all 50 states, judges overruled the will of the people. Proposition 8 is the 2008 ballot measure that California voters approved 52.3% to 47.7%, upholding marriage as the union between a man and a woman. It passed in the blue state the same year liberals came out in force to elect Barack Obama the first time around. Chief U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker later overturned the measure. Fridays 5-4 Supreme Court decision to force every state to issue homosexual marriage licenses included the supportive vote of Justice Kennedy. Republican 2016 presidential candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz called the marriage ruling as well as Thursdays ruling upholding Obamacare, both naked and shameless judicial activism. Breitbart News Ben Shapiro wrote of Justice Kennedys opinion, Justice Kennedy just redefined a fundamental right and forced elected state governments to slap their stamp of approval on that right. Justice Kennedy was also one of five justices voting to overturn the President Bill Clinton signed Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 2013. As the Court struck down DOMA, it also decided to refrain from a substantive ruling on Prop 8. The lower court decision to overturn the measure stood. Justice Kennedy dissented the decision to not issue a ruling. A ruling against Prop 8 at the Supreme Court level could have invalidated similar measures in other states.",1

"Title: Sound Waves Reveal Huge Cache of Diamonds  Article: Study finds 12 percent of Earths oldest mantle rocks are made from diamond. From MIT:  There may be more than a quadrillion tons of diamond hidden in the Earths interior, according to a new study from MIT and other universities. But the new results are unlikely to set off a diamond rush. The scientists estimate the precious minerals are buried more than 100 miles below the surface, far deeper than any drilling expedition has ever reached. The ultradeep cache may be scattered within cratonic roots  the oldest and most immovable sections of rock that lie beneath the center of most continental tectonic plates. Shaped like inverted mountains, cratons can stretch as deep as 200 miles through the Earths crust and into its mantle; geologists refer to their deepest sections as roots. In the new study, scientists estimate that cratonic roots may contain 1 to 2 percent diamond. Considering the total volume of cratonic roots in the Earth, the team figures that about a quadrillion (1016) tons of diamond are scattered within these ancient rocks, 90 to 150 miles below the surface.

"Title: Troubled South Bend abortion facility to cease abortions Friday  Article: NewsAbortion South Bend, IN, November 4, 2015 (OperationRescue)  Womens Pavillion, the last abortion clinic in South Bend, Indiana, will halt abortions on Friday, November 6, 2015, making the South Bend area abortion-free. The clinics troubled owner, abortionist Ulrich Klopfer, will surrender his facility license now that he has dropped his appeal of a decision issued in June by the Indiana State Department of Health to revoke the Womens Pavillions operating license. The ISDH notified Klopfer of its intent to revoke the Womens Pavillion facility license in June after he failed to adequately correct numerous deficiencies discovered by inspectors. Klopfer still faces possible revocation of his medical license or other discipline for hundreds of violations related to failing to include required information from state reporting forms and failing to report suspected child sex abuse in a timely manner. Klopfers pattern of omitting critical information on the state-mandated reporting forms served to cover up for child rapists and made it nearly impossible for the State to investigate suspected cases of child sex abuse or determine whether the abortions done by Klopfer were within the legal gestational limits in Indiana. Womens Pavillion was raided by police serving a search warrant in March, 2014. Klopfer was criminally charged with failing to report suspected child sex abuse. We have no idea how many little girls were handed back to their abusers by Klopfer. He did everything he could to protect the rapists at the expense of the safety of little girls that depended on him to save them.",1
"Title: British PM May Puts Britain First- Goes Hard Brexit  Article: Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE Brexit Britain and the U.S. tighter than ever. Welcome to the emerging new world order British PM May Puts Britain First- Goes Hard Brexit Taking a cue from soon to be President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Theresa May put the economic and financial interests of Britons ahead of its relations with their fellow Europeans. May went hard Brexit, that is, a complete break from her European partners. No half measures. In a recent speech, May clearly and without conditions or qualifications stated her governments desire to trigger Britains exit from the European Union and the single market within two years of the upcoming triggering date. May re-asserted that her countrys priorities were to gain complete control over its borders and its immigration policies. In other words, complete control over whom Britain wanted to admit or reject as immigrants to Great Britain. The European Union is based upon, inter alia, the free flow of European Union citizens among its various member states. As a EU member, it would be impossible and contrary to EU rules and regulations for Britain to prevent EU citizens from other EU nations from immigrating to Britain. May also wanted Britain to have complete sovereignty and judicial jurisdiction over its people and its companies. In other words, May wanted the British people to have nothing to do with the European Court of Justice, which had jurisdiction over EU members and their citizens. Similarly, though being a member of the EU customs union had its privileges, it had also its definite disadvantages: namely, the customs union set tariffs on goods imported into the European customs union bloc.",0
"Title: USDA Ruling Imperils 257  Article: USDA Ruling Imperils Food Supply By Christopher J. Petherick Despite widespread opposition to genetically modified (GM) crops, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently approved GMalfalfa, threatening organic farms across the United States. In a related development, official Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documents that were recently leaked show that the federal bureaucracy ignored concerns from its own scientists that a new, advanced pesticide will likely kill honeybees. Bees are already struggling to survive in this country due to mysterious and bizarre condition: colony collapse disorder (CCD). On Jan. 27, the [USDA] announced it would allow the unrestricted, nationwide planting of genetically engineered alfalfa, reported the Rodale Institute, the nations leading organic advocacy organizations. The concern among organic growers is that, in the years ahead, GM alfalfa will contaminate natural and organic alfalfa, because, unlike most crops, alfalfa pollen can travel for miles, mixing in with other alfalfa varieties in the area. In a landmark 2006 study, Colorado State University researchers found GM alfalfa contaminated almost all of the alfalfa for miles around one test field that had been planted with the lab-created plants. They concluded: The [GM alfalfa] gene was found at 83 percent of the collection sites, out to a distance of 1.7 miles from the pollen source. Why the concern over GMalfalfa? Well, alfalfa is the most common feed source for livestock such as cattle, sheep and goats.",0

"Title: Student radio host says tranny on air gets a lesson in liberal censorship (video)  Article: A University of Minnesota-Morris student radio host was thrown off the air and confronted by police when he used the word tranny during an on-air discussion about Antifa violence. UMM student Brandon Albrecht and co-host Taylor Lehmann were discussing the lack of Antifa style violence at their university on a recent episode of their show, Deplorable Radio, when Albrechts remark drew the ire of an unnamed individual who reportedly serves as the station manager. The manager falsely claimed that tranny is hate speech which cant be said on-air because of FCC rules. Heres a report on the incident via The College Fix:  Deplorable Radio is a weekly show on KUMM hosted by students Brandon Albrecht and Tayler Lehmann. Albrecht told The College Fix in an email that the programming is a mix of politics, music, and some random musings about current events locally and around the world. The duo was notified of the cancellation two weeks ago after Albrecht used a controversial word on-air to refer to transgender individuals. During a discussion about the universitys lack of Antifa violence, Albrecht said the campus was too small for a potential violent activist to hide his identity. You know, you can definitely, you see one tranny thats trying to punch someone, Albrecht told The Fix he said on-air. You know its automatically that one guy that you know Im talking about. I bet you know. Im not going to dox anybody and name them on air. But you two know if I say the tranny who looks like hes going to punch someone. Yep. About fifteen minutes later, Albrecht told The Fix, the student station manager came into the studio with a UMMPD officer and told us to leave.",1
"Title: The Young and the Stupid  Article: Oh, the virtue-signaling was hot and heavy as conservative and ostensibly libertarian media outlets competed to see who come up with the most self-righteously abusive rhetoric to describe North Korean Politburo member Kim Yo Yong, sister to Kim Jong Un. BuzzFeed grabbed the prize with a garbage monster  BuzzFeed being an expert when it comes to garbage. Reasons Nick Gillespie could hardly contain his joy at the fusillade of hatred: It was younger media outlets and personalities such as Buzzfeed and CNNs Jake Tapper that called bullshit on such stories. In Gillespies world, young is a synonym for good, because the young and the stupid will inherit the earth. Tapper is one of the War Partys most fulsome cheerleaders, and BuzzFeeds working relationship with the US State Department during the Obama administration was pretty brazen: but if Gillespie means young and dumb, or young and bought off, then perhaps hes right. If you hate US leaders more than you hate the Kim Jong-un regime, tweeted Tapper the tool, you really need to read up on North Korea and he helpfully supplied a link to Human Rights Watchs analysis of North Korea. Hatred of foreign bogeymen is what Tapper, Gillespie, and all those no-longer-quite-so-young media mavens deal in: were supposed to hate Kim Yo Yong, those North Korean cheerleaders, and anyone who isnt in a tizzy about North Korean propaganda supposedly broadcast by the media. Because, you see, simply showing a smiling and attractive Kim Yo Yong next to the dour and ill-at-ease Mike Pence is perversely fawning over the former.",1

"Title: Nintendos War on Women, Minorities and Democracy  Article: Special Investigative Report with Ray Charlston If you are like many people 30 and under you may have grown up on video games. Perhaps your family had a Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo, Gameboy, or a Nintendo 64. Perhaps you or your children own a Nintendo Wii. You may think video games are a harmless hobby or an enjoyable form of recreation, but think again! Video games can promote racism, sexism and anti-democratic attitudes! Nintendo Co. Ltd, headquartered in Kyoto Japan was literally founded on sexism, racism and Japanese Imperialism. Founded in 1889, its hateful legacy continues on to the present. Video games have spread around the world, poisoning the globe with hate. For this special report I will be interviewing Dr. Norman Frederickson of the Campaign for Justice, Equality and Peace. His organization is dedicated to fighting hatred and exposing bigotry and intolerance. RC: Dr. Frederickson, thank you for agreeing to accept this interview. NF: Of course. I was happy to accept your invitation this is a very important issue. One that I might add, I am deeply concerned about. RC: I understand that you have done extensive research into video games, Nintendo games specifically and what youve found has been, more than a little troubling? NF: Yes, indeed. Our children are being taught racism, sexism, colonialism, and even feudalism in these so-called Nintendo video games.

"Title: Islam and secularism want to monopolize the public square. Heres why thats concerning  Article: OpinionFreedom, Politics - World January 9, 2018 (Turning Point Project)  Secularists like to advise Christians that, for the sake of social harmony, they ought to keep their religion to themselves. Religion, they argue, is a private affair between an individual and his designated deity, and ought not to be dragged into the public square. Moreover, they helpfully add, its an imposition on others to confront them with beliefs that they may find offensive. As for themselves, secularists have no qualms about imposing their own values on everyone within reach. They are convinced of the rightness of their beliefs, and consequently they dont think twice about forcing Christian bakers, florists, and photographers to endorse gay weddings. They are also convinced that they know whats best for your children. And whats best for them, they are quite certain, is that they learn all the latest fashions in gender identity and marriage equality. In his groundbreaking 1984 book, The Naked Public Square, Richard John Neuhaus argued that the public square can never be naked for long. In other words, it cannot be neutral about values: If it is not clothed with the meanings borne by religion, new meanings will be imposed by virtue of the ambitions of the modern state. In short, the committed secularist wont be satisfied with the removal of the crche from the town square. Hell insist that it be replaced with something that more accurately reflects American diversitysay, a monument to Margaret Sanger or a statue of James Obergefell. Of course, secular societys reach extends well beyond the town green.",1
"Title: Krugman Uses the D-Word as Millionaire Pols Gear up to Screw Already-Suffering People  Article: I've witnessed several outbreaks of corporate-sponsored Beltway horribleness, when politicians, seizing a chance to realize their political and ideological fantasies, surpass their normal everyday plutocratic pursuits and baldly, in broad daylight, really stick it to non-rich people. Among the worst: NAFTA, the invasion of Iraq, and the bank bailouts. But I don't know that I've seen anything more appalling than this latest offensive in the class war disguised as a debate about debt. There is no crisis. There is no crisis. Do you feel me yet? There is no crisis. Everyone knows the ceiling with be raised. The Republicans have acknowledged as much. Wall Street and the Chamber of Horrors will not allow their GOP puppets to default. But (millionaire) pols of both parties are exploiting this phony crisis to cut government spending. Why? Because they want to cut government spending. Because Wall Street wants them to cut government spending. Because conservative Republicans and their kinder gentler cousins in the Democratic Party known as neoliberals have wanted to cut government spending, including Social Security, for years. Because it's Grover Norquist's world and we're just dying in it. The austerity (but not for wars or Wall Street)-mania would be harmful and right-wing even if the economy were humming along. But you probably know firsthand that we're having a spot of trouble on the economic front, like history-making trouble that's sending analysts back to the nineteen-thirties for precedents.",0
"Title: Mortician arrested after spending 8 hours with penis stuck inside corpse  Article: A mortician from Savannah, in Georgia, was arrested this morning after his penis got stuck inside a dead mans rectum, causing him to get caught several hours later. 67-year old Alfred Mortimer Evans was laying on the body of a 47-year old car accident victim when his colleagues arrived this morning and he was visibly stuck in this awkward position. He immediately admitted that he had been in this position for several hours and asked his co-workers for help. Unfortunately for him, his colleagues were unable to help him and they had to call the emergency services. Joey Dunmore, one of the paramedics who was called on the site, described the scene in an interview with the Savannah Daily Herald. He was laying on top of the corpse with his pants around his knees. He didnt really seem to feel any pain, but he was obviously humiliated. It took paramedics more than an hour before they could free him, and he was then immediately arrested by officers of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department. 17 criminal charges have been filed against Alfred Evans, including indecent treatment of a corpse, disorderly conduct, indecent exposure and possession of illegal drugs. Since the accused has worked on the night shift at the Chatham County Morgue for 43 years, and the investigators believe he could have sexually abused several other corpses in the past, and they expect to file more charges over the next few days.

"Title: Navajo Nation sues U.S. government for $160 million over toxic waste damage to their community  Article: (Natural News) The Navajo Nation recently filed suit against the United States government  to the tune of nearly $160 million  for damages and ongoing injuries resulting from a mine spill and the toxic waste that was released into the environment near the tribes territory. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken responsibility for the devastating spill, and the agency is also the lawsuits primary target. The lawsuit is seeking a cool $159 million in damages, as well as an additional $3.2 million to cover expenses that have already been submitted to the EPA but have not yet been reimbursed. The catastrophic spill took place in August 2015. An EPA clean-up crew was tasked with pumping out and decontaminating sludge from the mine, but things took a turn for the worse when the team destabilized a dam of loose rocks. Consequently, this led to 3 million gallons of mine waste water and tailings  containing heavy metals like cadmium and lead, and other toxic elements like arsenic and beryllium  into Cement Creek, a tributary of the Animas River. Naturally, the EPA has maintained that this incident was just an accident. However, some have proposed that this was no accident. It was predicted that perhaps the agency would intentionally sabotage the mine as a means to secure Superfund money. And sure enough, just over a year after the accident, the Gold King Mine was declared a Superfund site. On September 7, 2016, the EPA declared that the area would be on its list of contaminated areas due for federally funded clean-up. Why werent they more careful the first time around? Who knows.",0

Interestingly, Gillespie reportedly took up the Confederate cause at the last minute. [No, Ed Gillespie Doesnt Support Removing Confederate Monuments, Gillespie Campaign, June 12, 2017] This last minute pandering may have saved him.

Stewart was a fanatical defender of President Trump during the campaign as Virginia State Chairman, memorably championing the Republican candidate even when the party turned on him after the Access Hollywood tape. Stewart was fired for his trouble but still backed Trump. Now, because Donald Trump remained silent, Stewart was narrowly defeated in a primary he could have won.

The WHO has tallied 32 suspected or confirmed cases in the northwestern area of Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumbathe near the border with the Republic of Congo, including 18 deaths, between April 4 and May 9. The outbreak, declared by the DRC health ministry on Tuesday, is the DRCs ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976,when the deadly viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team. Scientists are greatly concerned that this outbreak in the remote Bikoro region will travel 175 miles to the city of Mbandaka  the capital of Equateur province and home to around 1.2 million residents.

""A New Study Says Nearly 6,000 Died In Puerto Rico,"" BuzzFeed shouts. ""Puerto Rico's Hurricane Maria Death Toll Could Exceed 4,000,"" the New York Times reports slightly more cautiously. 4,000, 4,600 or 6,000. Which is it? Hurricane Maria: 4,645 Died In Puerto Rico From Storm In 2017, NPR claims. Thats more specific. Except that the margin of error is plus or minus 3,852. Thats a sizable margin. Maybe 793 people or 8,498 people died Instead they surveyed 3,299 random Puerto Rican households, used the survey results to generate a death rate of 14.3 per 1,000 between September 20, the date the hurricane hit, and December 31. Thats over 100 days after the hurricane hit. I don't expect CNN to pay any attention to me. But Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post, the only fact checker who has any credibility and actually does serious open-minded search, also ran the numbers. In effect, the researchers took one number  15 deaths identified from a survey of 3,299 households  and extrapolated that to come up with 4,645 deaths across the island. That number came with a very large caveat, clearly identified in the report, but few news media accounts bothered to explain the nuances....

Authorities found all the children living in deplorable living conditions after raiding the property looking specifically for a three-year-old boy. According to The Daily Caller, the police didnt find the little boy, named Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, but they did discover 11 other children between the ages of one and 15-years-old being held in the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said in a statement posted to the agencys Facebook page Saturday. Hogrefe also added that he only saw a few potatoes and a box of rice as food at the compound. Abdul-Ghanis mother reported her son missing after Wahhaj took the boy, who turned 4 on Monday, to the park in Clayton County, Georgia, and didnt return, The Albuquerque Journal reported. She added the boy suffers from a medical condition. Investigators believe that the three-year-old boy, who turned four on Monday, they were looking for had been at the compound in earlier weeks. Siraj Wahhaj, 39, and Lucas Morten, two very heavily armed men who are believed to be extremist[s] of the Muslim belief, were running the horrifying compound, Hogrefe said. When police arrived on the scene, Wahhaj was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and several loaded 30-round magazines. He also allegedly had on him four loaded pistols.

Unfortunately, even though Americans are aware they were fooled in the 2010 midterm elections, particularly American women, they were fooled again and gave Republicans control of Congress. It is the epitome of Einsteins famous quote that insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome. It is also the epitome of stupid and if nothing else, the results of the 2014 midterms revealed that for the most part Americans are inherently stupid people. In the lead up to the 2014 midterms, exactly like the 2010 midterms, Republicans pledged that if they won control of Congress, they would focus on jobs and growing the economy. In fact, the day Mitch McConnell was sworn in as Senate Majority Leader, he had the temerity to say that now Serious adults are in charge here, and we intend to make progress. The House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), openly stated that Were focused on job creation and running a more efficient, effective, accountable government. That stated focus was a lie, but that is what Republicans are known for and yet Americans elected them anyway. Both McCarthy and McConnells assertions sounded precisely like Republicans in 2011 when they took control of the House, and yet the first items on their agenda besides taking steps to slash Social Security, give the Kochs and John Boehner a pipeline gift, were attacks on womens reproductive rights.

Aid to Women, a pro-life crisis pregnancy centre in downtown Toronto, is an example of a successful organization that reaches out to individual women who are considering having abortions. Opened in the late 1980s, the organization has saved over 2,000 babies from abortion and continues to rescue an average of two to three babies per week. Aid to Women is right beside the Cabbagetown Clinic, an abortion facility on Gerrard Street. ""We're very blessed to be located there,"" Frances Keet, general manager and counselor at Aid to Women, told The Interim. ""We can see from one end to another who's coming in."" This allows the sidewalk counselors to quickly approach a woman or teen planning to have an abortion and encourage her to come to their office next door. From 7:30 to 11:00 a.m., the time when most abortions are conducted, Aid to Women provides sidewalk counseling. Workers at Aid to Women try to dissuade women going into the facility from having an abortion by informing them of fetal development, the abortion process and consequences. They also offer help to women coming out, handing out pamphlets and referring them to organizations specializing in post-abortion help.",0

"Title: A Good Leak  Article: Last weekend, the FBI arrested an employee of a corporation in Augusta, Georgia, that had a contract with the National Security Agency and charged her with espionage. Espionage occurs when someone who has been entrusted to safeguard state secrets fails to do so.

The government claims that Winner downloaded and printed a top-secret NSA report, removed the printed version of the report from her employers premises, and then mailed it to The Intercept, a highly regarded international media outlet that exposes government wrongdoing.

But he cant be from Grand Prairie, if hes being deported, he has to be from somewhere else, that theyre deporting him to. It turns out that the answer to what inquiring minds want to know is he's a Nigerian pedophile, something that could easily go in the headline. Emmanuel Olugbenga Omopariola, 61, was convicted of indecency with a 7-year-old girl, an offense committed before he was naturalized, according to federal officials and federal court papers. He was deported back to Nigeria on Thursday, under escort from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. This deportation ends this U.S. chapter for Omopariola who sabotaged his own future and opportunities through his heinous crimes against a child, and his lies on his naturalization application and in interviews, said Simona L. Flores, field office director for removal operations for ICE in the Dallas region. The point about ""a move once reserved for Nazis"" is that the US government pursued a policy of denaturalizing anyone who could be shown to have lied on his immigration papers. Ann Coulter, discussing the number of undeported radical Muslims, et cetera wrote last year that  To this day, we have a whole office at the Department of Justice dedicated to finding and deporting Nazis even without proof they personally committed crimes against Jews.

By Founding New Industry Of Professional Protesting  Article: As protesters waited at locations across the country for President Trump to announce his nomination for Supreme Court Justice, many on social media were saying these people needed to simply, get a job. It is surprising to see that a good number of people believe these protesters are average citizens either taking time off work or are unemployed and just have the time to go out and protest. Those of us, who have followed politics for many years, however, know that to today's US protesters, this is their job. Unlike past street demonstrators of the 1960s and 1970s, whod gathered to protest the Vietnam War and the US government based solely on their strong beliefs, today's public displays of violence and civil unrest are totally carried out by well-organized businesses that have thousands of members and hire people as professional protesters. Thus, we have a massive employment sector of individuals who wake up every morning and prepare to go to work in their profession as protesters, just like the rest of us who do the same at our legitimate jobs.

"Title: The Trump Investigation and the Libyan War  Article: The Libyan War may have been Hillary's biggest scandal. It's also the scandal that hardly anyone talks about. After the murder of three Americans in Benghazi, conservative interest largely narrowed down to that particular incident rather than the larger context of the illegal war. But now it looks like the investigation of the Trump investigation is headed toward Libya,  In the heavily redacted, declassified version of the letter, which outlined why Graham and Grassley asked the Justice Department to consider opening a criminal investigation into Steeles communications with the FBI, the senators allege that Clinton associates were feeding Mr. Steele accusations against the Trump campaign, thereby calling into question Steeles credibility as a neutral source. Two sources familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, told me the redacted portions of the letter refer to the information compiled by Shearerfor the first time revealing some of the key details that were redacted in the original letter. Shearers information was passed to Steele by Winer. Winer, a friend of Steeles, was then serving as the special envoy for Libya, and had previously passed Steeles Russia and Ukraine reports along to the State Departments Europe bureau between 2014 and 2016... According to a source familiar with the matter, however, Steeles memorandum was actually a handwritten note on a copy of Shearers report that outlined its originthe foreign sub-source who had been in touch with Shearer. The note identified Shearer as a contact of Sidney Blumenthals, a longtime associate of the Clintons.",1
"Title: Theology chairmans same-sex wedding begins flood of challenges to Catholic identity  Article: NewsCatholic Church, Faith, Homosexuality, Marriage July 8, 2015 (CardinalNewmanSociety) -- The Episcopalian marriage of Fordham Universitys theology chairman to his same-sex partner, just one day after the Supreme Courts marriage ruling, begins a new flood of challenges to Catholic identity that most Catholic colleges and universities are unprepared to face, warns Cardinal Newman Society President Patrick Reilly. Even if a Catholic college leader wants to uphold Catholic teaching on marriage, the persistent embrace of dissent and opposition to the Church at many Catholic universities makes it highly unlikely that the law will now permit them to uphold moral standards for professors, Reilly said. The fact that a theology chairman at a Catholic university apparently waited for the Supreme Courts ruling to publicly affirm his disregard for Catholic teaching is a sign that the sky has opened, and wayward Catholic universities are about to face a flood of consequences following upon decades of inconsistent Catholic identity. Dr. Patrick Hornbeck II was declared married at St. Bartholomews Episcopal Church in Manhattan, according to The New York Times.",1
"Title: Muslim students want Florida student expelled for refusing to try on a hijab on Hijab Day  Article: Imposing Islamic absolutism on the public square continues apace. Kathy Zhu is a 19-year-old student at the University of Central Florida. She was offered to try on a hijab on Hijab Day. She refused and posted a message on Twitter to criticize the initiative. After that, the Muslim organizers asked the University to expel her. All of this is revolting (and predictable). What may not be necessarily predictable is that the young woman is not backing off and arguing against these thugs on Twitter. The University has since issued a message to indicate that the student would not be expelled. Here is a video released by Kathy Zhu explaining her position and talking about the snowflake mentality: (thanks to Gisele)  https://twitter.com/PoliticalKathy/status/959237457962242048/video/1  It bears mentioning that there are no Star of David Day or Wear the Cross Day either.

"Title: Fellowship of the Minds  Article: I despise the illegal-alien-loving folks in California. From Fox News: The illegal immigrant alien and seven-time felon who was acquitted of murder and assault in the 2015 San Francisco fatal shooting of 32-year old Kate Steinle was sentenced to three years in prison on Friday. Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, who has been in custody since shortly after the shooting, was credited for time served. He will be on parole for 48 months and will remain in custody to face federal charges. The case sparked national debate over immigration reform and so-called Sanctuary Cities that shield illegals from deportation, of which San Francisco is one. The felony possession was the only conviction to come out of Garcia Zarates trial in November. The jury decided Steinles death, the result of a ricochet bullet fired from roughly 100 feet away, was an accident. At a hearing Friday, Garcia Zarate entered the courtroom wearing huge oversized bright orange sweatshirt and sweatpants. He was uncuffed and smiling as he shook the hand of each member of his defense team, including new attorney Tony Serra. His attorneys requested a new trial, but the judge denied the motion.

Sessions met with local partners in the Central American country as the White House held its own press conference discussing the transnational criminal organization responsible for a wave of third-world brutality across the United States. As Sessions met with Salvadoran President Salvador Snchez Cern and the attorneys general of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala on strategy to combat the group, his department announced that the Salvadoran government had charged 113 MS-13 members in a sweep that netted 593 total gangsters in the war torn nation. MS-13, the popular name for Mara Salvatrucha, grew out of Salvadoran refugee communities in Los Angeles, California, many of whom fled to this country in the 1980s to escape El Salvadors horrific civil war and the right-wing death squads operating throughout Central America at the time. The gang is now estimated to have tens of thousands of members in the United States and throughout Central America. MS-13 is suspected of responsibility in numerous crimes of shocking barbarity in previously peaceful communities across the United States.

"Title: Francis: A Pope for our times  Part 3  Article: NewsCatholic Church EDITOR'S NOTE: The following is the third of seven excerpts from a talk by Fr. Linus Clovis at the Catholic Truth Scotland Conference in June 2016. Part 1 is here and Part 2 is here. To read his presentation in its entirety, click here. November 2, 2016 (LifeSiteNews)  In Genesis, we read that the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to till it and keep it. That is, God assigned Adam two tasks: first he was to cultivate the Garden and secondly, he was to guard it. His failure in the second task gave the serpent his opportunity. Christ entrusted to Simon Peter the visible leadership of the Church with the double task of feeding and tending the flock. That is, as a good shepherd, he was to guard, protect and preach the Faith to the flock and so keep them from error and deception.\ Our Lord, at the Last Supper, warned Peter that the serpent was already watching and merely waiting for an opportunity to attack. Specifically, with words expressing both what Satan desired and what God permitted, Christ said: Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren. God permitted this trial for at least two reasons. First, that the Apostles might understand how weak they were of themselves and second that after their fall, they would rise again by His grace and would be cleansed and purified as sifted wheat.",0
"Title: Why JPMorgan Believes Central Banks Can No Longer Save The Day  Article: In recent weeks, JPMorgan has turned decidedly sour on the US equity market: one month ago, on March 3, JPM announced that ""for the first time this cycle"", it has gone underweight stocks. Equities, credit and commodities have all rallied in the last three weeks, as some of the immediate threats to the world economy have faded from attention, possibly only because the bad earnings season has wound up. But, to us, the fundamentals of growth, earnings and recession risk have not improved, and if anything have worsened. We remain wary of the near-empty ammo box of policy makers. Our 12-month-out US recession odds have risen to 1/3, while equity-implied odds have instead fallen to near 1/5. But even with no recession this year or next, we see US earnings rising only slowly by low single digits and see little to boost multiples. The eventual recession should bring US stocks down some 30%, creating a strong downward risk skew to returns over the next few years. We use the rally in stocks to sell it and go underweight stocks, versus HG corporate bonds and cash. The strong rebound of the past few weeks does create near-term momentum, and thus keeps our first UW small. To be sure, the continued bounce since the JPM call has not been exactly reassuring of the forecast's accuracy. However, what is surprising is that when faced with unpalatable price action, sellside researchers usually flip their call quickly. Not in this case, because in a surprisingly candid piece released overnight, JPM's Jan Loeys doubles down, and after asking rhetorically ""Can central banks really save the day, or cycle? "", his answer is no.",0
"Title: US Bishops Organization Gives Glowing Review of Homosexual-Sex Propaganda Film  Article: News By Hilary White WASHINGTON, December 15, 2005 (LifeSiteNews.com) - The Catholic Church identifies homosexuality as a serious moral and psychological disorder of unknown origin, one that is serious enough to make a man who suffers from it ineligible for priestly ordination. Nonetheless, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) has issued a glowing movie review of the homosexual propaganda film, Brokeback Mountain, a story of two rugged cowboys who engage in homosexual liaisons and adultery. The films theme is a favorite of homosexual folklore: two lonesome cowboys, removed from the repressions of artificial social mores by their work in the great rugged outdoors. Freed from the constraints of female society, their passions erupt in what is depicted as some deep, natural, repressed well. The sex is depicted off screen in a way described by the author of the short story upon which the film is based as a manly act, quick, rough, laughing and snorting. The unnamed USCCB reviewer, in keeping with the now-standard tone of acceptance required of Catholic progressives, walked a hair-thin line between Catholic teaching and wholehearted approval of the homosexual lifestyle. The Catholic Church, the reviewer writes, makes a distinction between homosexual orientation and activity, Ennis and Jacks continuing physical relationship is morally problematic. He goes on to praise the film saying, While the actions taken by Ennis and Jack cannot be endorsed, the universal themes of love and loss ring true. A Christian activist who has worked to debunk the propaganda of the homosexual movement was more forthright.",1

Yet in past centuries people have defected to Cuba  white French agriculturalists fleeing the slave rebellion in nearby Haiti and black sugar cane cutters from Curacao searching for a post-slavery future. Several covetous American presidents tried to buy Cuba outright in cash. Former Soviets and modern Russians come to Cuba, as do millions of foreign tourists.

"Title: Blowback: CNN Pushes Effort to Ban the Term Fake News'  Article: This article was originally published by Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars.com  CNN is now pushing an effort to ban the term fake news after the slogan became synonymous with CNN itself thanks to President Donald Trump. In a CNN opinion piece written by Hossein Derakhshan and Claire Wardle, who are affiliated with the globalist Council of Europe, the authors argue that the term fake news has become meaningless and lost its power because politicians (primarily Donald Trump) have hijacked it as a way to undermine the media establishment. The authors decry the fact that many people now believe the mainstream media peddles fabricated stories and that information monopolies are being challenged by the ability for anyone in the world to have a platform. Remember when the mainstream media & the Hillary campaign invented the term ""fake news"" in an effort to discredit alternative & right of center media outlets? Yeah, that went well. pic.twitter.com/HJPpIQEr4j  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) November 27, 2017  Complaining that less powerful agents can harm large institutions or established individuals, Derakhshan and Wardle warn that trust in institutions is declining and that only through intervention at the level of public education (ie indoctrination) can this be reversed. Of course, the real reason media elites want to clamp down on the term fake news is because its original intention, to smear and discredit opponents of Hillary Clinton, right of center media outlets, and people who distrust the mainstream media, has completely backfired.",0
"Title: Woman who became the UKs oldest mom by IVF now admits it was a mistake  Article: NewsBioethics UK, March 26, 2012, (LifeSiteNews.com) - Susan Tollefsen, who caused an uproar when she became Britains oldest first-time mother in 2008, now says achieving pregnancy at age 57 by IVF was a mistake, and is calling for all IVF clinics to set an age limit of 50. Tollefsen, a retired teacher, became pregnant using sperm from her one-time partner Nick Mayer, who is 11 years her junior, and a donor egg. The media reported at the time that she and Mayer spent 15,000 on fertility treatment in Russia after they were refused by British clinics because of her age. A daughter, Freya, was born by Caesarean section in March 2008. Tollefsen and Mayer are now separated due to what she told the media was the shock to their relationship of having a child so late in life. Tollefsen, now 61, revealed to the Telegraph newspaper that during a serious illness over Christmas she was not able to care for 4-year-old Freya, and came to the realization that she might not live long enough to raise her child. I was so ill, I literally thought I was dying. I kept thinking about Freya - and for the first time, I realized I might not be there for her any more, she said.

The couple who were allegedly practicing fisting, a sexual activity that involves inserting a hand into the partners rectum, called 9-1-1 after they were unable to release the mans hand from his boyfriends anal cavity. Both men were transported by ambulance to San Mateo Medical Center where hospital staff successfully released the mans hand only 14 hours later, a complicated task due to heavy inflammation, blood loss and risk of laceration, say doctors. I know Ill never have the opportunity to give birth in my lifetime, but I think I know what it feels like now Mathew Cunning, 23, told reporters.

"Title: Collectivism & Social Engineering Going On Right Under Our Noses  Article: A friend asked me recently if I found any similarities between the collectivist Home Owners Association (HOA) in the U.S. and living in communist Romania in cinder block apartments the size of the average hotel room. We did have a different HOA in these reinforced concrete high rises, the Residents Association (Asociatia Locatarilor). Its governing board was chosen from the least outspoken residents who sometimes doubled as informers to the Security Police, reporting on the comings and goings of the residents and on their political statements made accidentally in ordinary conversations with neighbors. The Residents Association decided when the water heaters were to be serviced, what kind of cold and hot water schedule we were going to follow, how much heat we received from the government mothership, how much any repairs would cost, and how the due bills were to be divided evenly between all families, if the association would pay the electric bill for some widow who was behind on her dues, which mechanic they were going to hire to fix whatever was broken in the apartment complex. In the egalitarian utopia, the total bill was to be split equally between all families, regardless of how many people lived in one apartment. Some had children, some lived alone and the consumption was vastly different but the contribution share had to be equal. It was similar at work; no matter how little effort a person put in, they were paid the same. The incentive died quickly when people realized effort and extra work did not count.

"Title: How the sexual revolution, multiculturalism, and identity politics radicalized liberalism  Article: OpinionAbortion, Homosexuality, Politics - U.S. Abstract August 30, 2013 (Heritage Foundation) - Beginning in the 1950s, a more radical form of liberalism emerged in the academy that sowed the seeds for the sexual revolution and multiculturalism. Neo-progressivism mobilized the New Left of the 1960s, transformed American politics, and continues to dominate the cultural and political conversation today. It combines what neo-progressives call personal politics (the idea that American citizens have a right to all forms of self-expression) and cultural politics (the idea that cultural groups are entitled to special status) together as the twin pillars of a new identity politics. As a result, citizens today have more, not less, freedom from government in the realm of sexual expression, and the American electorate has been fractured into various groups. In the past two decades, a new, more radical form of progressivism has taken over American social and political life, even finding its way into the White House. Fresh instances of this new progressivism appear every day. For example: At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, progressives officially supported same-sex marriage as a civil right and unofficially rejected the word God in their platform; President Barack Obama, labeled the First Gay President by Newsweek for his support of gay rights, has instructed the Attorney General of the United States not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act; and Vice President Joe Biden has said that discrimination against transgendered persons is the civil rights issue of our time.

LifeSiteNews published the first instalment on April 7, the second on April 8, the third on April 13, and the fourth on April 14. April 16, 2015 (LifeSiteNews.com) -- From September 1979 to April 1981, Pope John Paul II gave a series of sixty-three talks which became the foundation of what is now known as his Theology of the Body. In them he reflected on the meaning of the human person, sexuality, and Christian marriage. He taught that the second and third chapters of Genesis reveal core truths about man, for written there are original human experiences, which are always at the root of every human experience. We are made in Gods own image, he says, yet we do not know who we are unless we know who God is. In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eves love for each other was a mutual gift of their whole beings, a self-donation of their personhood made through free acts of their wills. The giving of their sexual powers, their masculinity and femininity, was in harmonious submission to this mutual giving. They desired, more than anything else, the good of their spouse, the good of the others entire being. It was total love. And the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed, says the author of Genesis. John Paul II pointed out that these passages do not express a lack but, on the contrary, serve to indicate a fullness of consciousness and experience. Shame came into existence only with the advent of sin in human nature, and at that point our first parents had not yet sinned.",0

According to data from Rasmussen, which tracked approval ratings for Barack Obama and Trump, Trump ends the year at 46 percent approval and 53 percent disapproval  the exact spread Obama ended his first year with. Recall that Obama received fawning, slobbering media coverage for everything he did and said. MSNBCs Chris Matthews actually said on air that hearing Obama speak causes him to feel this thrill going up my leg. I dont have that too often. Matthews all but teared up on air in a segment of Morning Joe, and also called Obamas election New Testament stuff. And he was far from alone in his bootlicking. Coverage of Obama was so over-the-top in Obamas candidacy that Time magazines Mark Halperin warned his Obama-toady media colleagues about their pro-Obama bias. That type of coverage continued throughout Obamas first year. Conversely, Trumps dealt with the ongoing fake Russia collusion scandal, along with dishonest fact-twisting and omission of truths done deliberately in order to cast him in a negative light. According to Pew Research Center, early coverage of Trump has been three times more negative than it was for Obama (62 percent negative for Trump versus 20 percent negative for Obama) in their first years.

"Title: Chinas Communist Party makes persecuting Christians a priority  Article: Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. Religious experts say China, a country where only state-approved religious exercise is permitted, has one of the fastest growing Christian congregations in the world. The country is on track to have more than 250 million Christians a huge majority of them worshiping in forbidden underground churches by 2030. Unfortunately, Chinas leaders consider the growing religious population a threat to its authoritarian government. Those leaders are setting the stage for what may become one of the biggest religious persecution campaigns in modern history. A 2014 report from The Telegraph declared that the officially-atheist communist country would become the worlds most Christian nation in the next 15 years. But Chinas Christian community is also one of the worlds most imperiled faith groups in the world. For Chinese Christians who opt to worship in churches which have gained the governments seal of approval (only about 30 million of them, according to estimates), a typical service is rife with government propaganda and takes place under the watchful eye of surveillance cameras forcibly installed by the government. Worshipers and church leaders who fail to carry out their faith in a way that pleases the government are frequently attacked, beaten and arrested by police. In recent years, the country has also taken to destroying crucifixes on display in Chinese provinces, confiscating church property, levying hefty arbitrary fines and fees against churches or simply razing places of worship which displease the countrys totalitarian leaders.",1
"Title: Buy-Stuff-Cheap CEO If Urban Youths Of Color Take Things At My Store, We Wont Call The Police!  Article: By Ivan Fernando In a move that has earned praise from many progressives, but sneers and ridicule from the radical and racist right, Stan Marshall, the CEO of Buy-Stuff-Cheap a small chain of retail stores that sells everything from sneakers to refrigerators in eastern Maryland, recently banned employees from reporting the theft of store goods by people of colour under any circumstances. This journalist had the privilege of interviewing Mr. Marshall by phone last week. A transcript of that interview follows below. Ivan Fernando: I want to thank you for agreeing to this interview. I understand that your store has been under fire recently for your new policy of allowing poor African-American urban youths to take merchandise, regardless of their ability or willingness to pay for it. If I understand further, they are also allowed to destroy property, in order to vent their rage over racism and economic inequality? Can you tell me a little bit about that policy and how it came about? Stan Marshall: Thank you for contacting me! It is a pleasure to talk to you today. Recent events have proven that the overwhelming majority of police officers are violent white racists. Suppose a young man of color comes into my store, and takes something. Is it ok to call a bunch of racists, who will likely beat him within an inch of his life or even kill him because of his skin color? I say no! In fact, why punish him at all? We need to level the playing field so that everyone has the same amount of money and property! I am a proud social justice warrior! I believe in giving back to the community!

"Title: Boy Raised by Apes Discovered in Malaysia  Article: Borneo| Malaysian authorities have announced this morning that they had finally been able to capture the feral child of Borneo that had been reported by hundreds of different villagers of the region over the last two last two years and had become the focus of the local media recently. The young boy had been reported to accompany a group of Bornean ourangutans that seemed to have adopted him as one of there own. We are trying to establish the actual age and identity of the boy explains Osman Mahmat Rahman, public relations officer for the Royal Malaysia Police (RMP). The boy is extremely nervous and aggressive when approached by humans and that made his capture quite complicated, especially since the other ourangutans attempted vigorously to defend him. We had to tranquilize three of the adult apes using darts filled with sedatives, before we could lay our hands on the child. We really went to great lengths to make sure we did not injure him during the operation. The boy was immediately taken to the hospital and was put under the custody of agents from the Social Welfare Department. A preliminary evaluation realized by doctors at the Borneo Medical Center, allowed to determine that the boy was in suprisingly good health considering the circumstances, having grown rather normally and showing no signs of malnutrition.",0
"Title: Obama Administration Officials, FBI, And CNN Coordinated To SET UP Donald Trump  Article: The tables are turning and the tides have most definitely shifted in favor of president Donald Trump. Now new evidence is revealing that top Obama Administration officials coordinated with each other and the FBI to help CNN run a damaging and unverified story on Trump and the infamous salacious dossier. The mainstream media wont touch this story with a ten-foot-pole because it not only shows the unsurprising amounts of actual lies and fake news they put out daily, but it also details how CNN was used to run damaging stories at the behest of the Obama administration. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs released new emails on Monday night that allegedly show that Obama administration officials coordinated with each other to help CNN run a damaging story on President-elect Donald Trump based on salacious and unverified information contained in a politically motivated dossier financed by Trumps political enemies (Hillary Clinton and the DNC.) According to The Daily Wire, the emails, which were obtained by Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI), show that the Obama-era administration officials used coded language to refer to the Steele dossier. The following timeline of events and communications were in the committees letter:  1. January 6, 2017, 9:44 a.m. FBI Chief of Staff Jim sent an email to unspecified recipients stating, the director is coming into HQ briefly now for an update from the sensitive matter team. 2.

"Title: Clinton Researcher Commits Suicide Before Releasing Info on Crime Couple  Article: Longtime Republican political operative and private equity industry manager from the Chicago area Peter W. Smith was found dead of alleged suicide 10 days after being interviewed by mainstream media about his investigation of Hillary and Bill Clinton. Sadly, information that would confirm or deny his suicide is not being released by the Chicago police or the coroner. Will Smith become simply one more open-ended mystery in the long string of individuals whove died under questionable circumstances after publicly revealing Clinton wrong-doing? By Mark Anderson Considering the sordid history of political intrigue and foul play surrounding Hillary and Bill Clinton, the rather mysterious death in Rochester, Minn. of a longtime investigator of the Clintons isnt generating anything close to the level of public interest it deserves. Whats worse is that national TV-media outlets evidently are blacking out news about investigator Peter W. Smiths suicide and how and why he died in mid-May. This broadcast-news suppression is even harder to explain considering several sizable newspapers and social media have to some extent covered Smiths apparent suicide. Yet, the national TV networks did not run with the story, even as they obsess nonstop over flimsy Trump-Russia collusion allegations. The Wall Street Journal, to its credit, took the lead in publishing reports on Smiths research on Hillary, having interviewed Smith just 10 days before he was found dead. Smith is reported to have left a suicide note, stating that he took his own life at age 81 due to ill health.",1

Dave Joyce (@RepDaveJoyce) January 20, 2018  OK, so, in less than 3 weeks, the memo should be made public to the people. Frankly, I have no idea why it would take three weeks to release this document. Are they going to redact it so much that the American people would know what all the fuss is about or is it really just a part of how slowly bureaucracy works in DC? All of this began on Friday when #ReleaseTheMemo hit Twitter. While Rolling Stone magazine claims that Russian bots (ie. Boris and Natasha of Bullwinkle fame ) were responsible for the popularity of the hashtag, the reality was that people simply want to see the evidence for themselves.

"Title: Is All Great Art Religious?  Article: In my last article for LRC I wrote about literature from the perspective of a somewhat educated abecedarian. I take solace that my opinions are not totally ridiculous by comparing my view of Madame Bovary (first developed about 25 years ago when I read the book) with that of George Sand (that I only recently read). Quoting myself, In Madame Bovary on the other hand, Emmas passions make her almost an evil person. In fact almost every character is nasty. The basic theme being that below the facade of bourgeois respectability lurks great evil. Thus in the end Emma kills herself and everyone is miserable. Here is what Sand wrote to Flaubert (CCCII. To Gustave Flaubert, in Paris Nohant, 12th January, 1876) about the realism of his writing. That desire to depict things as they are, the adventures of life as they present themselves to the eye, is not well thought out, in my opinion. Depict inert things as a realist, as a poet, its all the same to me, but, when one touches on the emotions of the human heart, it is another thing. You cannot abstract yourself from this contemplation; for man, that is yourself, and men, that is the reader. Whatever you do, your tale is a conversation between you and the reader. If you show him the evil coldly, without ever showing him the good he is angry. He wonders if it is he that is bad, or if it is you. You work, however, to rouse him and to interest him; you will never succeed if you are not roused yourself, or if you hide it so well that he thinks you indifferent. He is right: supreme impartiality is an anti-human thing, and a novel ought to be human above everything.",0
"Title: ISIS leader calls for the Impeachment of Donald Trump  Article: The leader of the Islamic State terrorist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has called for the American Congress to impeach Donald Trump. In a seven-minute video made available on the internet yesterday, the self-designated Caliph of the Islamic State in Irak and Syria criticizes the American President for his anti-Islamic behavior and policies and demands that impeachment procedures begin immediately. Mr. al-Baghdadi calls for the United States Congress and Senate to impeach Mr. Trump and replace him with a Muslim President. He says that if they fail to do so, the country will suffer Gods wrath. Allah disapproves of this fiery-haired devil and will strike down on America if it doesnt repent. Throughout the video, the terrorist leader used a very colorful language, calling Mr. Trump a pig, a dog, a man-whore and many other colorful names. This pork-eating infidel is a sex addict and a psychopath. He is an evil man who has no respect for women. Mr. al-Baghdadis numerous critics about Mr. Trumps treatment of women are particularly surprising, considering the fact that ISIS is known to practice sexual slavery on a large scale. The terrorist leader also criticizes Trumps possibly incestuous relation with his daughter as well as his relation with the Devil worshipper Steve Bannon. The month of May has been cruel to the Islamic State (ISIS) forces, as the terror organization has suffered several defeats in both Iraq and Syria. With a significant amount of ground lost already this month, the future looks rather bleak for the Islamic State.",1
"Title: Pregnant on pointe shoes: how one professional dancer risked her career to choose life  Article: NewsCulture of Life Join a Facebook page dedicated to ending abortion here. DUPAGE, Illinois, September 15, 2011 (LifeSiteNews.com) - Rebecca was twenty-three years old, single, and enjoying a successful career as a professional dancer when she found out to her dismay that she was pregnant. The news couldnt have come at a more inopportune time. It was February of 2009, and Rebecca had just signed a contract with the Washington National Opera to dance for them from April to June of that year. I had to decide whether I was going to continue with the contract, or if I was going to step out because I was pregnant, the dancer, who wished to be referred to only by her first name, told LifeSiteNews in an interview. That was a really challenging decision to make, because I wasnt sure how much my body would show in the beginning. I was scared, nervous, and upset, she confided. Rebecca, who had been brought up in a pro-life, Christian home, now felt that she was faced with the agonizing choice of either ending her pregnancy or potentially ending her career. While married dancers do sometimes perform after having children, often by maintaining connections with the industry through their dancing husbands, Rebecca says the situation is not the same for single mothers.",0
"Title: Bright kids shouldnt be dulled down with drugs  Article: This piece, written by Geoffrey Hosta, was originally published by the Foundation for Economic Education. When my stepdaughter, Adrienne, was in first grade, her teacher pressured me to put her on stimulants. She explained that Adrienne daydreamed; she also became hyper when she learned something new. Inattention and hyperactivity are classic symptoms of ADHD. They can be treated with Adderall or Ritalin, her teacher explained. But I knew this was absurd. Adrienne did not have ADHD. That just sounds like any bright kid, I responded. If shes ahead of her classmates, shell be bored sometimes. Smart Kids Are More Likely to Be Misdiagnosed  I was on to something. Some scientists believe that kids with IQs in the top 5 to 10 percent of the population are especially at risk for ADHD misdiagnosis. Although there are no hard numbers, experts estimate that somewhere between one-third and one-half of intelligent kids diagnosed with ADHD are misdiagnosed. Even the manual used to diagnose ADHD warns doctors against confusing intelligence with ADHD. Why is misdiagnosing ADHD in intelligent children more likely? As I suspected, smart kids such as Adrienne engage in the same behaviors as children with ADHD. For example, both bright kids and those with ADHD are over-excitable and inattentive. Both question authority. Even so, her teachers suggestion merited further consideration. After all, intelligent children such as Adrienne can still have ADHD. And unaddressed ADHD could make my stepdaughter more likely to abuse substances, suffer joblessness, and falter in school. Consequently, I was not going to ignore Adriennes problem. But I am also a doctor.",0
"Title: Former Beatle Ringo Starr Claims the Real Paul McCartney Died in 1966 and Was Replaced by Look-Alike  Article: Beverly Hills | The former drummer of the Beatles, Ringo Starr, surprised the world this morning during an interview in his luxurious Californian residence when he admitted that the 45-year old rumors about the alleged death of Paul McCartney in 1966 were actually true. In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Mr. Starr explained that the real Paul McCartney had died in a car crash on November 9, 1966, after an argument during a Beatles recording session. To spare the public from grief, the Beatles replaced him with a man named William Shears Campbell, who was the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest and who happened to have the same kind of jovial personality as Paul. When Paul died, we all panicked! claims Ringo, obviously very emotional. We didnt know what to do, and Brian Epstein, our manager, suggested that we hire Billy Shears as a temporary solution. It was supposed to last only a week or two, but time went by and nobody seemed to notice, so we kept playing along. Billy turned out to be a pretty good musician and he was able to perform almost better than Paul. The only problem was that he couldnt get along with John, at all. William Shears Campbell, better known as Billy Shears, does indeed disappear  from records in 1966 and no traces of him can be found after Pauls alleged death. Mr. Starr alleges that the group did send out a lot of hidden messages through the years to prepare the population for the truth. He notably says that the entire Sgt.",0
"Title: Soros Buying San Diego DA Race  Article: Leftist billionaire George Soros is injecting big money into a San Diego district attorney race as part of his larger effort to install extremist prosecutors across America who will refuse to enforce inconvenient laws that liberals and progressives dont like. Soros, who turns 88 in August, has been underwriting district attorney races across America in an effort to dismantle the criminal justice system, empty the prisons, and sabotage the enforcement of immigration laws. Soros supports state and local efforts to resist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and wants to cripple police in order to advance the neo-Marxist abstraction known as social justice that simplistically breaks the world down into race, class, and sex or gender. Radicals claim that American laws and institutions are inherently corrupt and that these systems protect, for example, wealthy, white, native-born, non-disabled males at the expense of everyone else. Getting people who share Soross worldview into public office at every level is key to promoting his ugly vision of how America, which he calls the main obstacle to a stable and just world order, should look. Months ago Soros saturation-bombed his Open Society Foundations philanthropy with an $18 billion donation, likely guaranteeing OSF will remain one of the most important players in left-wing activism for decades to come. According to the New York Times, this was one of the largest transfers of wealth ever made by a private donor to a single foundation.

The policy banned government funding of foreign pro-abortion groups like the International Planned Parenthood Federation. The two posts criticize Trump for cut[ting] off family planning for millions of poor women globally and for reinstat[ing] Reagan-era abortion restrictions. Lawler also actively promoted the Women's March on Twitter.

Article: All signs point toward an upcoming large-scale Israeli/U.S. attack on Lebanon and Syria and all the sycophantic mainstream media are manipulating the public as we speak to gather support for a war to end all wars. The Greanville Post reported that as the media prepares the feast (war), what well be fed is being revealed. Russia and Iran are the main course, with Lebanon and Syria, who will be devoured first, as the hors-doeuvres. As always, the media play along as if they dont yet know whats coming.

And the media awaits this war with baited breath as they count down to the dramatic moment when they can report the incident that will compel the innocent to attack the guilty. Anyone with half a brain can see the greatly increased anti-Russian propaganda of the past few weeks.

"Title: Elderly woman accused of training her 65 cats to steal from neighbors  Article: Columbus, Ohio | An 83-year old woman was arrested this morning and accused of training dozens of cats to steal jewelry and other valuables from her neighbors. The Columbus Police Department opened an investigation on Ruth Gregson and her 65 cats in October after several neighbors reported small objects being stolen from their homes. Several victims reported being visited by Ms. Gregsons cats before noticing the disappearance of several shiny objects, like valuable cutlery and pieces of jewelry. Despite their skepticism, investigators began a surveillance operation and were amazed by what they discovered. According to Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs, dozens of cats were constantly coming and going, bringing home anything that shined. She was like Fagin in Oliver Twist, but she was using cats as thieves instead of children. In less than three hours of surveillance, the detectives saw the cats bring home more than a hundred objects. Upon searching Ms. Gregsons house, investigators found $650,000 worth of jewelry and precious metal among piles of worthless shiny baubles. A total of 65 adult cats and 17 kittens were found on the site and entrusted to the Columbus Humane Society. Chief Jacobs says the elderly woman confessed to training her cats to steal, saying the felines had to earn their meals. She would only feed the animals if they brought home valuables, so the animals had to steal every day in order to survive.",0
"Title: Child Hunger Is Exploding In Greece  And 14 Signs That It Is Starting To Happen In America Too  Article: Michael Snyder Activist Post The world is heading into a horrific economic nightmare, and an inordinate amount of the suffering is going to fall on innocent children. If you want to get an idea of what America is going to look like in the not too distant future, just check out what is happening in Greece. At this point, Greece is experiencing a full-blown economic depression. As I have written about previously, the unemployment rate in Greece has now risen to 27 percent, which is much higher than the peak unemployment rate that the U.S. economy experienced during the Great Depression of the 1930s. And as you will read about below, child hunger is absolutely exploding in Greece right now. Some families are literally trying to survive on pasta and ketchup. But dont think for a moment that it cant happen here. Sadly, the truth is that child hunger is already rising very rapidly in our poverty-stricken cities. Never before have we had so many Americans unable to take care of themselves. Food stamp enrollment and child homelessness have soared to brand new all-time records, and there are actually thousands of Americans who are so poor that they live in tunnels underneath our cities. But for millions of other Americans, the suffering is not quite so dramatic. Instead, they just watch their hopes and their dreams slowly slip away as they struggle to find a way to make it from month to month. There are millions of parents that lead lives that are filled with constant stress and anxiety as they try to figure out how to provide the basics for their children. How do you tell a child that you cant give them any dinner even though you have been trying as hard as you can?",0

"Title: Aliens and Ancient Sumer  Article: Ancient Sumer has been the subject of debate for numerous years. According to the ancient alien theory it is there, in ancient Mesopotamia where everything began. Among the stories of incredible encounters, Gods, and technology which are part of ancient Sumerian culture, there are several stories which point towards an extraterrestrial origin. Then came the Flood and after the Flood kingship again descended from heaven. After kingship had descended from Heaven, begins our King List, there were five cities before the Flood whose eight fabulous kings ruled no less than 241,200 years. Following the hegemony of these five antediluvian cities, the document goes on to tell us: The Flood swept over everything. After the Flood swept over everything, and kingship had (once again) descended from Heaven, Kish became the seat of kingship. The Ancient Sumerians lived in Mesopotamia, between the Tigris and the Euphrates and represented a higher form of culture. They possessed very advanced astronomical knowledge and were able to perform calculations with 15 digits, that is, with numbers above 100 trillion. To compare it to other ancient civilization, I believe it suffices to say that the Greeks could not count above 10,000. The Sumerians who predate the Babylonians established modern civilization and culture as we know it. History tells us that the first ten Sumerian kings lived a total of 456,000 years, which gives us an average lifespan of 45.6 thousand years each! Each Sumerian city that was protected by a god.",0

"Title: Hows your Financial I.Q.? Take the test!  Article: Americas federal, state, and city governments are profligate and irresponsible with taxpayers money, over-spending themselves into declared and undeclared bankruptcy, and a national debt that now exceeds Americas GDP. But if we, the American people, are better managers of our own finances, not only would more of us realize the financial black hole government is in, we would also demand more fiscal prudence from officialdom. Alas, Hadley Malcolm reports for USA Today, April 24, 2012, that despite the recession, most Americans still know NOTHING about their finances, especially young people. Here are the facts: Americans in their 20s hold an average debt of about $45,000, which includes everything from cars to credit cards to student loans to mortgages, according to a PNC financial independence survey released last month. At the same time, Americans 18-29 year old have a much higher jobless rate of 12.4% , well above the national rate of 8.2%. Financial literacy is especially needed for young Americans because they face an increasingly complex global economy that is credit-driven and puts more responsibility on individuals to plan for and manage their retirement accounts. But too many young Americans are financial illiterates.

"Title: PragerU: Douglas Murray Explains the Suicide of Europe | Blog Posts  Article: The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity Islam, Douglas Murrays important book, continues to influence the debate on allowing mass immigration of Muslims, a historic enemy of the West. The political problem was Europes foolish invitation, led by Germanys Chancellor Merkel, to millions of dissatisfied muslims to come live in the West. But the psychological cause is a disconnect from the history of Europe civilization, which still includes the Enlightenment. Murrays analysis is that Europes elite (but not its average citizens) feel a loss of confidence about the last centurys failures of history require the penance of surrendering to the diverse hordes of the Third World. From the outside, it does seem Euro-elites are throwing in the towel on the continent with its complicated history.

To put it starkly: Europe is committing suicide. How did this happen? Its a complicated story, but there are two major causes. The first is the mass movement of peoples into Europe. This has been going on steadily since the end of World War II but sped up massively in the migration crisis of 2015, when more than a million migrants poured into Europe from the Middle East, North Africa and East Asia. The second, and equally significant, is that Europe lost faith in itselfits beliefs, its traditions and even its very legitimacy.",1

He said that it was unacceptable for Christian leaders to support marriage for all and to participate in gay pride parades, where there are children. Excoriating the Protestant churchs moral decline is one thing, but now Wagner has joined a religion that teaches that homosexuals must be put to death. The Quran contains numerous condemnations of homosexual activity: And Lot when he said to his people, Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people.And We rained upon them a rain of stones. Then see how was the end of the criminals. (Quran 7:80-84)  Muhammad specifies the punishment for this in a hadith: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, Whoever you find doing the action of the people of Loot, execute the one who does it and the one to whom it is done. (Sunan Abu Dawud 4462)  Moral decline or moral myopia, giving a divine sanction to murder? Wagner has chosen the latter.",1
"Title: Jahi McMath may be past the point of recovery as her condition deteriorates, family says  Article: NewsEnd of Life January 8, 2014 (LifeSiteNews.com)  The body of 13-year-old Jahi McMath may have so deteriorated in the 25 days since she was declared brain dead that it may be impossible for her to recover, her family's attorney said today. On December 8, Jahi McMath experienced severe complications from a tonsillectomy at Children's Hospital in Oakland, California, and fell into a coma. Doctors declared her brain dead on December 12. I want her on [the ventilator] as long as possible, because I really believe that God will wake her up, her mother, Nailah Winkfield, said. But in California a person is considered deceased the moment he or she is declared brain dead. Hospital attorney Douglas Straus said flatly that the hospital would not perform medical procedures on the body of a deceased human being. The decision generated nationwide sympathy for the young girl and her family. The Terri Schiavo Life and Hope Network (Terris Network) joined the battle, issuing a statement last Tuesday that the child retains all the functional attributes of a living person, despite her brain injury. This includes a beating heart, circulation and respiration, the ability to metabolize nutrition and more. Jahi is a living human being. Last Friday, California's Alameda County Superior Court granted the family the right to remove their daughter from Children's Hospital.",0
"Title: ISIS Leader Calls for American Muslim Voters to Support Hillary Clinton  Article: Top ISIS leader now believed to be the number two behind the terrorist organization, Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani, put up a video this week following the second presidential debate asking American Muslim voters to support Hillary Clinton. The controversial video that was taken down by YouTube only hours after it was uploaded showed top ISIS leader Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani threatening those who would decide to vote for Donald Trump and calling them infidels and goat f-ers.  All Muslims who will show support for the dog-faced Trump are guilty of masiya (mortal sin)   ISIS No.2 leader, Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani He also claimed that even if Hillary was a woman and a two face devil, had the charm of a pig and was treacherous as the snake, that the Democratic presidential hopeful was at least in league with the allied countries of the Islamic state such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Supporting the dog-faced Trump Al-alwani also warned all Muslims not to take his warnings lightly and that supporters of Trump would be severely punished on earth and in Jannah (afterlife). Trump is a dog, he is the scum of the earth. He boasts that he will take our oil and join Russia, Syria and the Shia Iranians against us in our holy fight he added, visibly angry.

"Title: Anti-Gay Activist Claims Beauty and the Beast Promotes Inter-Species Breeding %%  Article: Sweet six-and-a-half pound baby Jesus! Who knew that Disneys beloved Beauty and the Beast promotes inter-species breeding? Anti-gay activist Kevin Swanson, who previously warned us that How to Train Your Dragons Gobber the Belch is Destroying Civilization, really hates gays. And he really hates the idea of a human having sex with another species, even when that whole idea is only in his own mind. Because there is no shape-shifting. And no curses that cause shape-shifting. It just doesnt happen. I dont want to suggest this is a very purient case of projection, but folks, this is a very purient case of projection. PFAWs Kyle Mantyla tells us that Swanson said Beauty and the Beast was an insidious effort to homosexualize the next generation of eight and ten-year-old kids and ensure that they are indoctrinated into the homosexual lifestyle. This is how revolutions take place. You are in the middle of a cultural revolution in the United States of America. No, this is not the cultural revolution that Mao Tse-tung brought to China; this is a different kind of cultural revolution, but Im going to say its just about as dangerous  though a bit more insidious. Its the Frozen scandal all over again. The water has gotten a bit too deep for Swanson, just as it was for Michele Bachmann when she attacked Disney for turning our kids gay. But his oxygen-starved mind wasnt done: Even worse, Mantyla writes, Swanson said, the film is promoting inter-species breeding, which he said Hollywood has been pushing since the days of Star Trek. Film history, Swanson! Why did it take so long to notice Disneys unwholesome proclivities?",0
"Title: How is Trump Supposed To Negotiate Immigration When His Opponents Are Constantly Calling Him A ""Racist""?  Article: Once upon a time, it wasnt okay to smear your political opponent with something like racist or bigot without first showing some evidence. Sadly, in todays America, these words get thrown around as if they have no meaning and as if everyone can agree to their usage. The latest example comes to us through the immigration debate where the left and the media continue to attack the President for supposedly calling some 3rd world nation(s) sh**holes, something the President denies ever saying (and several of the people in the meeting have backed him up on this point). Heres the problem, while the Presidents language may be vulgar and his word choice poor, its a sentiment that most Americans agree with, and its at the heart of a larger debate about how we choose migrants to accept into our nation. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) made a similar argument while defending the President from his detractors, on NBCs Meet the Press when he asked how the President is supposed to negotiate on DACA and illegal immigration if his opponents are all calling him a racist. Its as if the left doesnt actually want to negotiate a compromise, they simply want to smear the President and make compromise impossible. Rand Paul: I dont think the comments were constructive at all. But I also think that to be fair, we shouldnt draw conclusions that he didnt intend. I know personally about his feelings towards Haiti and towards Central America because when I was not a candidate for president and he wasnt a candidate for president, I went down there on a medical mission trip. I did about 200 cataract surgeries with a group of surgeons in Haiti and the same in Central America.",1
"Title: Over 3 million sign petition to reinforce Romanias marriage law  Article: NewsMarriage May 16, 2017 (LifeSiteNews)  The people of Romania have spoken. In a country of approximately 20 million people, more than 3 million have signed a petition to enshrine in their constitution marriage between a man and a woman. In this way, the definition of marriage could be neither bent nor broken to accommodate homosexual partnerships, essentially banning same-sex ""marriages"" in the Christian country. The petition, a project of Romanias Coalition for Family, seeks to clarify the definition of marriage by stating the family is founded on the freely consented marriage between a man and a woman, their equality, and the right and duty of parents to ensure the upbringing, education, and instruction of children. The clarification is necessary because Romanias Constitution as it now stands speaks of marriage between spouses, written during an earlier period in history when spouses always implied marital relationships as between one man and one woman. To withstand current social and political forces that seek to exploit the now insufficiently descriptive language, an amendment to the constitution is required. The expressed will of the people is now in the hands of legislators. As of May 9, legislation is advancing.",1
"Title: These Are The Top Financial Concerns Of Ordinary Americans  Article: While institutional investors and money managers have a very specific list of worries when it comes to their ""financial concerns"" such as Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), monthly/quarterly performance and redemption requests, losing top traders, what the year end bonus will be, order fill slippage, being frontrun by HFT algos, what the Fed chairwoman may say any given day, whether it is 3:30pm or if it is a Tuesday, ordinary Americans have a far simpler list of concerns. According to a recent Gallup poll, the one thing that has most Americans very/moderately worried is ""whether or not they have enough money for retirement. "" The list of the top concerns is presented below: In a country in which the economy is barely sputtering, and where all the benefits from 5+ years of QE have accrued exclusively to the top 1% of wealthy, that nearly two-thirds of society is concerned about its retirement prospects will hardly come as a surprise. Going down the list, the next highest concern, not being able to pay medical costs in the event of a serious illness or accident, worries 53% of Americans. This is down from a record high of 62% in 2012. Third on the list of Americans' top financial worries is not being able to maintain the standard of living they enjoy, with nearly half of the country's adults citing this concern. Together, retirement savings, unexpected medical costs, and maintaining one's standard of living typically top the list of the eight financial items that Gallup has tracked annually since 2001.",0
"Title: CBC put its anti-Catholic bigotry on display in pro-gay attack on school board chair: critic  Article: NewsCatholic Church, Homosexuality TORONTO, December 14, 2015 (LifeSiteNews)  The CBC recently targeted the chair of Torontos Catholic District School Board for refusing to state that gay-straight alliances belong in Catholic schools. But pro-family advocates laud Angela Kennedy for her defiance in the face of an anti-Catholic agenda, and point out that Catholics have a constitutional right to teach their faith in the Ontarios publicly-funded Catholic schools. On December 2, CBCs Metro Morning host Matt Galloway repeatedly grilled Kennedy, a 15-year veteran trustee who on November 30 was acclaimed TCDSB chair, about whether gay-straight alliances belong in Catholic schools. And Kennedy repeatedly replied that Catholic schools have supportive clubs and a mental health strategy for students. Galloway pointedly noted that Kennedy avoided the term gay-straight alliance, and that she refused to confirm that such clubs belong in Catholic schools. He led off the segment by stating that Kennedy had opposed GSAs in the past. Kudos for her, was the response of Campaign Life Coalitions Jack Fonseca. By not saying gay-straight alliance, what she was saying was, no, of course not, they dont belong in Catholic schools, he told LifeSiteNews. The question posed to Kennedy was idiotic, Fonseca added. Why would you ask a faithful Catholic whether gay pride clubs belong in a Catholic religious school? Clearly, it was a dishonest question.",1
"Title: Kobach? Ratcliffe? Gowdy? (NOT Christie!) Trump MUST Choose Immigration Patriot To Replace Jeff Sessions | Articles  Article: President Trumps biggest challenge right now is deciding who will be his next Attorney General. Especially after the loss of the House, this decision is critical for immigration patriots. By all accounts, the acting Attorney General, Matt Whitaker, is a solid replacement to Jeff Sessions. Whitaker took the job upon the recommendation of immigration patriot hero Rep. Steve King, and he is reportedly intent on reining in special counsel Robert Mueller. But hes only temporary, and Democrats in Congress are determined to make sure this acting AG has the shortest tenure possible. [ Top Democrats Vow to Block Matthew Whitaker From Interfering in Russia Inquiry , by Sheryl Gay Stolberg, New York Times, November 11, 2018]  Trump may just want Whitaker to throw a wrench in the Mueller investigation and leave. Trump aides hope he will limit the scope of Muellers final report and protect Trump from a subpoena. It would be easier for a man not dependent on Senate confirmation to accomplish this task more than anyone else. [ Matthew Whitaker: An Attack Dog With Ambition Beyond Protecting Trump , by Adam Goldman, Michael D. Shear and Mitch Smith, New York Times, November 9, 2018]  The curtailment of the Mueller investigation would be welcome news to immigration patriots and conservatives generally. It would finally free up the President to focus on more important matters and clear up the impeachment cloud hanging over his head. Of course, that issue is not everything for immigration patriots. With the House in the hands of the Democrats, the chances of Republicans passing serious immigration reform in the next two years is practically nil.",0

Gina Haspel, Trumps pick to succeed Mike Pompeo as head of the CIA, is a thirty-year veteran of the agency, one well respected by intelligence professionals from both parties. If confirmed, she will be the first woman to run our most important security agency. But despite this feminist victory, the Dems are likely to muddy the waters at her confirmation hearings by smearing her with allegations she oversaw torture at a black site in Thailand in 2002. Typical of what we can expect is the New York Times editorial titled, Having a Torturer Lead the CIA, even as the charge about the black site was shown to be untrue. Once again, the party bereft of ideas and principle resorts to emotional obfuscation and accusation to advance their ideological prejudices. So, once again, it is necessary to lay out the facts and partisan hypocrisy behind the torture charge that has damaged our ability to gather the intelligence necessary to defend our safety and security. Start with the imprecise or even willfully distorted language that always perfumes unsavory ideologies. In everyday use, torture can mean anything from a visit to the dentist to the sadistic mayhem of brutal regimes like Iran or North Korea. As a result, indiscriminate, lurid connotations and emotions attend the use of a word like torture, which of course is what makes it so useful for partisan smears.

"Title: Obama and Trudeau Seizing The Oceans  Article: It is an irrefutable truth that the UN stole Gods gift to mankind before sanctimoniously calling it the Law of the Sea Treaty. It was the wisdom and majesty of God Almighty that gave us the treasures of Earths oceans. And in their incomparable greed and self-vested power, it was the unelected bureaucrats at the United Nations who seized them when no one but the politicians of the day were looking. The treaty also creates an International Seabed Authority with the power to levy a $250,000 tax (application fee) on anyone who wishes to explore the seabed. It would also tax (royalties) everything that might be excavated from the seabed. It requires technology transfer from the nations that have technology to the nations that dont  under the supervision of the U.N., of course. A more thorough analysis of the treaty is available online. Not only would this treaty give the U.N. jurisdiction over the open seas  70 percent of the Earths surface  it would require that U.S. sovereignty over U.S. territorial seas be exercised  subject to this Convention and other rules of international law. Outrageous! And this is one of the least offensive provisions.

"Title: NASA scientists confirm the reception of a message from God  Article: A team of astrophysicists linked to the University of California has announced this morning that one of the radio telescopes they use to search for extraterrestrial intelligence intercepted a transmission which they believe could be a message from God himself. The scientists, directed by Professor Dan Werthimer, are part of the SERENDIP (Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations) project, a program that attempts to intercept and decode radio transmissions from outer space. They announced that the Arecibo radio telescope, located in Puerto Rico, received on Saturday afternoon, a strong narrowband radio signal bearing the expected hallmarks of a non-terrestrial communication, originating from outside the solar system. The signal is said to be very similar to the famous Wow! signal received on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State Universitys Big Ear radio telescope. However, while the Wow! signal represented an incomprehensible series of letters and numbers, namely 6EQUJ5, this new signal spells a long series of 29 letters which spell five words in the ancient Hebraic language. According to the scientists who intercepted it, the message is surprisingly clear. The message can be translated as either I am Yahweh, Universal Creator or My name is Yahweh, Creator of the Universe.",0

"Title: A Reader Writes On The Merciless Indian Savages Of The Founding Era And An American Woman Who Fought Back | Letters  Article: Re: James Fulfords post Facebook, REASON Magazine, Thomas Jefferson, And The Merciless Indian Savages  From: A German-American Reader [Email him]  With regards to the latest hysterical banning by Facebook of the passage from the Declaration of Independence citing merciless Indian Savages brings up some interesting points. The first is that due to the revisionist history currently in vogue in the United States the only part of the Declaration now remembered is the flowery language in the Preamble stating all men are created equal that specifically, and only refers to the perceived unequal relationship between the British colonists and the Cr own. It was never intended to be a universalism, later used as a justification for a plethora of equal outcome-based laws and social justice programs that bedevil the nation. The Preamble should be interpreted in the context of the entire document, and in the case of the Declaration it was a list of strident grievances (e.g. directed Indian attacks) and demands by the rough and tumble British colonists justifying the colonies breakaway from Great Britain. I am sure the Facebook censorship staff have never read the entire Declaration of Independence before this incident, hence their shock. The second point is that depending on the tribe and circumstances the American Indians could be a nasty lot as was well known at the time being before the era of todays politically correct censorship (e.g. Facebook). And the colonists who did fight back were not hauled off into court for denying the Indians their civil rights.",1

Israel is attacking Syria more frequently and openly. Today, an Israeli jet was shot down. The U.S. is attacking Syria more openly and forcefully too. The risks of worse warfare to come in Syria are elevating. The U.S. makes the ridiculous claim that it recently acted in self-defense: It was self-defense. Obviously, we are not getting engaged in the Syrian civil war, Secretary of Defense Mattis said. Mattis lies. The lie is evident because the U.S. got engaged years ago by embedding its advisors with Syrian rebel forces. Underscoring its intrusion and presence in Syria, the U.S. declared an open-ended military presence in Syria. Syria condemned this border force in strong terms. The U.S. intervened in the Syrian Civil War within Syrian territory. The U.S. cannot now claim self-defense, the reason being that it has intentionally placed its military personnel in harms way without being invited by Syria. Thats an act of war. The only thing that Mattis can possibly claim is that the U.S. has not yet launched a full-scale attack on Syria and isnt mobilizing forces to do so. But the U.S. retains the option at any time of launching massive attacks from the air whenever it chooses to invoke the justification of self-defense for rebel forces or raise the issue of chemical weapons; and it has now launched several of these attacks.",0
"Title: Sarah Palin's Approval Rating Hits a New All Time Low %%  Article: As Sarah Palin basks in both the cash of, and the love from the Tea Party, a new Washington Post poll reveals that her political popularity among the nation as a whole has never been lower. Conservative Republicans give her a 71% approval rating and tea partiers put her at 60%, but the nation as a whole gives her only a 37% approval rating, and a 55% disapproval rating. The most striking number from the Washington Post poll was that only 17% of all Americans surveyed said that they held a strongly favorable view of the former Alaska governor. In contrast, 41% of respondents strongly disapproved of her. Palins rating with Independents mirrors her overall 37%-55% approval/disapproval rating. Her favorability rating gains one point with Independents to 38%, while her disapproval rating holds steady at 55%. Palin is popular with the Tea Party crowd, as she has a 60% approval rating with them, but the Tea Party as a whole is more popular than Palin herself. With all adults surveyed the Tea Party has a 41% approval rating. Although the gap is small, it is possible that Palins lack of personal popularity could end up damaging the Tea Party movement in the eyes of the nation at large. The Tea Party movement, even with its recent run of negative publicity, remains more popular than Sarah Palin. Palins approval ratings have remained in steady decline since October of 2008.

The memos, authored by former FBI Director James Comey, are about his nine private conversations with President-elect and President Trump. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who ruled in favor of the FBIs request to keep the Comey memos secret, also sits on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The FISA Court is the same court that approved the surveillance on Trump associates. Boasberg refused to release the documents on the basis they were still being used by special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation of the alleged Russian collusion with Trump associates. The judge ruled, the Comey Memos, at least for now, will remain in the hands of the Special Counsel and not the public. Its unfortunate, but not at all surprising, to see a FISA court judge side with secrecy over transparency on the very day the House Intelligence Committee released a very troubling example of abuse of trust within the FISA system, said Christopher Bedford, the editor-in-chief of TheDCNF. On March 16, one week after Trump fired Comey, the public first learned the former FBI director had penned a memo on a Feb. 14 Oval Office meetings with President Trump. Comey told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 8 testimony that he authored secret memos of all his meetings and conversations with President-elect and President Trump.",0

"Title: What Happens If The Government Shuts Down Tomorrow? Goldman Explains  Article: With just over 24 hours left until the US Federal Government may be shut down on Friday night should Republicans and Democrats fail to reach a ""stop-gap"" spending bill, something which is increasingly likely after Mitch McConnell said he is ""planning for a government shutdown"", clearly a political gambit yet one which may backfire and result in precisely what it is meant to avoid, the question then is what happens next. Conveniently, this morning Goldman answers precisely that question. But first, here is how the vampire squid handicaps the odds of a government shutdown today: as Hatzius et al write, ""there appears to be a substantial chance of a government shutdown at the end of the week. At the moment, we believe the odds of a lapse in spending authority after Friday, January 19, stand at around 35%. "" Here Goldman appears unduly optimistic... WHITE HOUSE SOURCES PEG CHANCES OF GOVT SHUTDOWN AT 50%: FOX ... Although even at 35%, this is a surprisingly high number. Why? Well, because ""the high-profile nature of the immigration debate and the lack of consensus among Republicans raise the probability that congressional Democrats will oppose an extension of spending authority. "" So with odds high and rising, the chance of a misstep, especially with Trump's loose twitter-finger, is likely much higher than Goldman's oddsbefore Goldman explains what happens next, first a quick look at the history of government shutdowns. Shutdowns are rarebefore 2013, the most recent shutdown had ended in early 1996because a short-term extension is always a possibility if a long-term agreement cannot be reached.",1

"Title: Did a Muslim Screaming Allahu Akbar Disrupt the Pentecost Mass in a French Cathedral?  Article: According to a French-language report in Riposte catholique, it happened on May 20, Pentecost Sunday for Roman Catholics, in Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes, France: a Muslim grabbed the microphone during the sermon by Bishop Jean-Paul James and screamed Allahu akbar. However, in yet another example of dhimmitude and willful ignorance from a Catholic bishop, Catholic officials deny that the intruder said Allahu akbar at all. Presse Ocan reported:  It took only one publication that was wrong, so that the rumor remains on the web: a man tore the microphone out of the hands of the bishop of Nantes on Sunday, in the middle of the solemn Mass of Pentecost, to shout Allahu akbar in the cathedral packed to the rafters. Relayed several hundred times over the Internet, what is then presented as an info from a very reliable source has begun to fuel fantasies. However, it cannot stand up to the objectivity of the facts. Father Benot Bertrand, Vicar General of the Diocese of Nantes, was on the right of Bishop Jean-Paul James when a man was on the podium. It was about 10:30 am, and the bishop began his homily in front of 1,500 to 2,000 people [] The man grabbed the microphone and made remarks in a foreign language. He did not shout Allahu akbar at all, says the vicar. Clinging to the microphone, he was determined to speak and seemed especially extremely fragile psychologically [] There are always malicious people who seek to fuel this kind of rumor and excite peoples minds when they should rather seek to calm them. It is not a matter of being naive, we remain vigilant in the national context, but everyone must stick to the reality and the objectivity of the facts.",1

This was signature jihad  we have seen jihadis separate Muslim from non-Muslims during the attacks at the Oberoi Trident hotel, the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower in Mumbai, at the Westgate in Nairobi, the beach resort in Tunisia, the gas complex attack in Algeria, etc. A little over a year later, the City Council of the same city, St. Cloud, Minnesota, rejected a moratorium on immigration.

The dismissal occurred less than two days before McCabe was planning to retire and become eligible to receive lucrative pension benefits. ""After an extensive and fair investigation and according to Department of Justice procedure, the Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) provided its report on allegations of misconduct by Andrew McCabe to the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR),"" Sessions said in a statement Friday.

"Title: Video Surfaces Of Trump Ogling Woman & Bragging About Hiring Teen For Looks  Article: The list of sexual assault and harassment allegations against President Trump seems to be continually growing, so its not particularly surprising when a new video or recording surfaces of him saying or doing something vulgar. These examples of the presidents troubling behaviors might not surprising, but that doesnt make them any less disturbing. One such video from 2007 has resurfaced and has been making the rounds recently. The video shows a portion of Trumps San Francisco Learning Annex speech in which he boasts about hiring a beautiful girl, 17 or 18, so beautiful as a waitress even though she had no waitressing experience. Trumps remarks (for which he was paid $1.5 million) about hiring the teenage girl because she was beautiful came when an audience member who introduced herself as Juliet asked him how many jets he owned and how she could apply to be a flight attendant. Trump responded by demanding Juliet come up on stage. Once she arrived at the podium, Trump gave her a very obvious once over and then wrapped an arm around her and said, Youre hired. He then kept her pinned to his side as he began to tell the story of the teenager that he was unable to turn away because of her good looks. My people said, Mr. Trump, she has no experience, so I interviewed her anyway because she was so beautiful. I said, Do you have any experience? She goes, No, sir. I said, When can you start? He asked, isnt that terrible?",0

The obvious question for those paying attention to American politics, or propaganda, at the time was that the Obama administration went out of their way to deceive the American people about the attack, claiming that it was the result of some Muslims who were upset about a video that was actually produced by a Muslim, not a Coptic Christian, who was an agent of former Attorney General Eric Holder.

"Title: Get ready for gas tax hikes  Article: Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. With the economy improving and an ambitious infrastructure plan on the White House agenda, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is beginning to make its case for a hefty increase in fuel taxes. According to Chamber President Tom Donohue, the group is looking to hike the gas tax by 25 cents a gallon over the next five years. Though the organization plans to ask the Trump administration and Congress for a gradual increase to ease pushback, it would also support a one-time hike in the full amount. Five cents [per year] over five years, but if we can get it all in the beginning, wed take it. Its simpler; you do it once, Donohue told reporters. You begin to accrue and build up a sock of money which youre going to need for these projects. Because the gas tax hasnt been increased since 1993, the proposal likely faces an uphill battle. But Donohue says the Chamber has new allies in the fight. Ive been pushing this for a long, long time, but now gangs of people are pushing it, he said in an interview. And because President Trump is eager to fund an ambitious infrastructure plan, the White House could play a key role in securing the increase. As reported by The Washington Post:  In private meetings, Trump has floated the idea of raising the federal gas tax by as much as 50 cents per gallon but received a chilly reception to that idea, particularly from Republican lawmakers. Still, aides say, the idea of an increase hasnt been taken off the table. As envisioned by the chamber, the 25-cent increase would be applied to the current taxes of 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel fuel.",0

According to Kerry, Commitment to Japans security remains ironclad and covers all territories under Japans administration, including the Senkaku islands. There has been some concern in Asia about whether the Obama administration would honor Americas defense treaties. This concern increased substantially after Obamas flip-flop on Syria, declaring that use of chemical weapons would be a game changer, and then backing off once Syrias president Bashar al-Assad killed hundreds of people with Sarin gas. After World War II, America signed a large number of mutual defense treaties with other countries. These include agreements with Japan, South Korea, Israel, Taiwan, the Philippines, the ANZUS agreement with Australia and New Zealand, a special treaty with Iceland, and the NATO agreement with all of Europe. Many people have questioned whether the administration would honor these mutual defense treaties during an actual attack. Kerrys statement was meant to reassure the Japanese.

British journalist Rossalyn Warren raised a rallying cry to abortion advocates to lobby Facebook to black out sites like LifeNews and Live Action, which she accused of producing vast amounts of misinformation  such as the correlation between abortion and breast cancer. Indeed, articles from these sites are more shared on Facebook than evidence-based, credible articles about abortion from reputable news outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post, she complained. According to Warren, whose work has appeared in the Guardian and Buzzfeed, the problem is that Facebooks criteria to assess whats fake news doesnt generally apply to pro-life sites.

America is coming home from Iraq. On May 1, 2003, on the carrier Abraham Lincoln, the huge banner behind President George W. Bush proclaimed, ""Mission Accomplished!"" That was eight years ago. And so, was the mission accomplished? Two-thirds of all Americans have concluded the war was not worth it. And reading the description of Iraq from the editorial page of the pro-war Washington Post, who can answer yes? ""Al-Qaida continues to carry out terrorist attacks. Iranian-sponsored militias still operate, and a power struggle between Kurdish-ruled northern Iraq and Mr. Maliki's government goes on. More Iraqis worry that, after the U.S. troops depart this month, the sectarian bloodletting that ravaged the country between 2002 and 2007 will resume."" And not all the Americans are really coming home. Some 16,000 will remain in the huge fortress that houses the U.S. embassy and in fortified consulates in Basra, Irbil and Kirkuk. All four sites will be self-sufficient, so U.S. personnel can stay clear of what The Wall Street Journal calls the ""perilous security situation on Iraq's city streets."" In each diplomatic post, the State Department employees will be outnumbered by private security contractors, 5,000 of whom will provide for their protection and secure travel.

"Title: Overweight German man who joined ISIS says they used him as sex slave  Article: Berlin | A 28-year-old German man who had officially joined ISIS forces in 2015 has recently escaped from Syria after he was allegedly turned into a sex slave by ISIS forces. The young man, who had converted to Islam in 2014, had pledged allegiance to ISIS hoping to become a full-fledged soldier in its war against Western civilization. Instead, he was rapidly turned into a sex slave for ISIS combatants, spending most of his time in captivity chained to a bed, dressed up as a Western-style woman and performing sexual services on ISIS soldiers daily until his recent escape. I went there to fight but I guess they had other plans for me, he told reporters, visibly ashamed. Upon my arrival, they kept pinching my ass, rubbing my nipples across my shirt and whistling at me, he said. At first, I thought it was all fun and games until I woke up one day chained to a bed, dressed in a robe with makeup and lipstick on my face, he recalls in horror. Dressed up like Marilyn Monroe Hermann Gottlieb, 28, says he was drugged the first week upon his arrival and woke up chained to a bed where he would spend most of his eighteen months of captivity. They forced me to dress up with wigs, lipstick, and makeup all the time. One of the commanders had a fetish for Marilyn Monroe and would even make me watch movies of her so I would talk like her, he told reporters.

"Title: Terror threat raised as Cotswolds Vicar declares Church of England CaliphateNewsBiscuit  Article: With much of the world distracted by the campaign against ISIS in the Middle East, Britain faces a new home-grown terror threat, after Stow-In- the-Wold vicar Jeremy Blythe pronounced an independent Anglican Caliphate stretching across much of rural Oxfordshire. We have seized control of the parish councils of Stow, Coln St Aldwyns and Daglingworth, announced Blythe this morning, and as I speak, our forces are advancing on Shipston on Stour. Asked why he had taken this action, Blythe explained We are sick of your Western materialistic values, with your Minidisc players and Sodastreams. We intend to go back to a purer time, when vicars wobbled about on bicycles, all vergers looked like Derek Nimmo and Cliff Richard was never anything other than non-threatening. While information from inside the Caliphate remains scarce, an Amnesty International report has already detailed a catalogue of human rights abuses, describing the number of forced jumble sales as shockingly high. The subjugation of women was also a big concern, with reports that some old ladies were being forced to bake up to twenty trays of flapjacks every day. Despite this, support for the Caliphate appears to be on the rise, with large numbers of foreign fighters flocking to the region.

"Title: ""The Homosexuals"" a grim documentary video on homosexuality filmed in the late 1960s  Article: In both of the documentaries, psychiatrists say that homosexuality is a psychiatric disorder and this is extensively drummed home in one segment of ""The Homosexuals. "" Some of the points that are made are: One psychiatrist says that there can't be any happy homosexuals because their psychological maladjustment prevents them from being happy. Their maladaptive behaviors will always get them into trouble. Homosexuals aren't born. Homosexuality develops in childhood, often during the first three years of life. The theories of how men become homosexual are discussed as if they are proven truths. Mother is overly protective, prefers the homosexual son. Father is emotionally distant, competes with son, may ignore him or be aggressive toward him. (There's no mention that DNA might be involved or that homosexuality might be a mixture of nature and nurture. ) The psychiatrists really don't cite any evidence for their pronouncements, they just pontificate. One says that up to 30% or homosexuals can change their behavior with treatment. Another mentions ""latent homosexuality,"" which was thrown about wildly in the 1950s. In a law enforcement segment: A 19-year old service member is entrapped for performing a ""lewd act"" in a men's room. Listen as he virtually begs the police to not tell his superiors. One of the police says that the homosexual problem is growing and he's worried about how this will affect society as a whole.

"Title: Republicans Fearmonger Over ISIS to Distract From Their Ineptitude  Article: Fear is a natural emotion that is induced by a perceived threat, or a specific stimulus happening in the present, or some future situation. In both human beings and animals, fear is modulated by cognition and learning and in humans it can be either rational and appropriate, or irrational and inappropriate; irrational fear is a phobia. Republicans have learned that sowing fear is a valuable campaign tactic, and the more irrational fear among their supporters, the more motivated they are to vote for Republicans promising to eliminate whatever perceived threat their bases phobia is grounded in. As political psychologist Drew Westen of Emory University wrote in The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation; In politics, the emotions that really sway voters are hate, hope and fear or anxiety. But the skillful use of fear is unmatched in leading to enthusiasm for one candidate and causing voters to turn away from another. If nothing else, Republicans are skillful at using fear to sway voters and lacking any record to run on, they are opting for fear in the leadup to the midterm elections. After the past few days of Republican fear-mongering over the perceived threat from the ISIS (ISIL) in Iraq and Syria, it is blatantly obvious that besides drumming-up support for a new Middle East war to profit their military industrial complex donors, they are in campaign mode.",1
"Title: Family Security Matters  Article: Obama CIA Nominee John Brennan Wrong for the Job by STEVE EMERSON , JOHN ROSSOMANDO February 8, 2013 America's top spy needs to be a steely-eyed realist, sensitive to emerging threats and keen about our foes' intent to deceive us. Unfortunately, President Obama's nominee to head the CIA, Deputy National Security Adviser John Brennan, has shown a tendency to fall for the bait from radical Islamists. Globally, he repeatedly expressed a hope that ""moderates"" within Iran and its terror proxy Hizballah would steer their respective constituencies away from terrorism. Domestically, he claims that radical Islam does not pose its own, unique threat to American security. He has helped strip language about ""radical Islam,"" ""jihad"" and similar terms from government vernacular, choosing instead to refer to ""violent extremism"" in an attempt to deny terrorists religious credibility. When it comes to jihad, he stubbornly maintains the word does not belong in conversations about terror, no matter what terrorists themselves say. Likewise, he also yielded to demands from American Islamists to purge law enforcement and intelligence training material of the terms ""jihad"" and ""radical Islam. "" Despite these positions, some American Islamists still oppose Brennan's nomination because he is considered the architect of the drone program which has killed scores of al-Qaida terrorists. That should tell him something.",0

"Title: Iran-Contra scandal comes to light  Article: The Iran-Contra scandal that led to the indictment of several Ronald Reagan Administration officials and sullied Reagans presidency began to unravel on this date 31 years ago when CIA contract pilot Eugene Hasenfus plane was shot down in Nicaragua on October 5, 1986. The Iran-Contra scandal and ensuing outrage over it from the political establishment was nothing more than political kabuki. The gist of the scandal is this: The Reagan Administration concocted an arms sale deal with Iran that included arms-for-hostages and that violated an embargo against that nation. It also violated the Boland Amendment that prohibited U.S. funds from going to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. The U.S. was the largest seller of arms to Iran while the U.S. puppet dictator of Iran, Shah Reza Pahlavi, was in charge. The Shah had been re-installed to power through a CIA-backed coup 1953 and propped up by the U.S. and UK until he was finally overthrown by radical Islamist elements in 1978. Months later, supporters of the Iranian Revolution that forced out the Shah seized the U.S. Embassy in Iran, capturing 52 Americans. The hostage crisis would last for four 444 days. Among the many actions President Jimmy Carter took against Iran during the crisis was the installation of an arms embargo. That  along with U.S. support of CIA-installed Saddam Hussein in Iraq  made the Iranians, who were at war with Iraq, open to making a deal with even The Great Satan.

Some in the media are touting the summer movie as the first successful abortion comedy ever made, but pro-life advocates are skeptical.

"Title: Iran and Hamas Test Limits of Israels Patience  Article: Three weeks ago, the BBC revealed that Iran was in the process of constructing a military base just south of Damascus near the town of Al-Kiswah, 31 miles from the Israeli border. The British broadcaster displayed what it described as satellite photos showing a series of symmetrical structures arranged in a deliberate pattern, and connected by a road. That base was hit over the weekend in the early morning hours of December 2. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that loud explosions were heard in the vicinity of Damascus and electricity was cut off in parts of the city. The Times of Israel, citing Arab media reports, noted that at least 12 Iranians were killed in the blasts and some of their names were posted on accounts of a messaging app associated with Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. As is its wont, Israel has not commented on the attack, preferring instead to keep its enemies guessing. Some reports have suggested that Israel employed Jericho surface-to-surface missiles while others maintained that the Israeli Air Force fired a number of missiles while over Lebanese airspace. Regardless of the manner of attack, it is clear that the Netanyahu-led government will not permit Iran to create a new front on Israels border. Israel has on numerous occasions attempted to convey this message through diplomatic channels utilizing the Russians as interlocutors. Notwithstanding these diplomatic efforts, the base was not dismantled thus compelling military action. For Israel, the creation of an entrenched Iranian forward operating base on its northeastern border is a red line that cannot be crossed.",0
"Title: Amazon Unveils 20 City Finalists For HQ2, Expects To Create 50,000 Jobs In Winning City  Article: On Thursday morning, Amazon announced that it had reviewed 238 proposals from across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to host HQ2, the companys second headquarters in North America, and has has chosen the following 20 metropolitan areas to move to the next phase of the process (in alphabetical order): Atlanta, GA Austin, TX Boston, MA Chicago, IL Columbus, OH Dallas, TX Denver, CO Indianapolis, IN Los Angeles, CA Miami, FL Montgomery County, MD Nashville, TN Newark, NJ New York City, NY Northern Virginia, VA Philadelphia, PA Pittsburgh, PA Raleigh, NC Toronto, ON Washington D.C.

Amazon expects to make a decision in 2018. Commenting on the selection process Holly Sullivan, Amazon Public Policy, said ""Thank you to all 238 communities that submitted proposals. Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough  all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity.

"Title: U.S Scrambles Jets as Tensions Threaten to Explode in Syria, Ukraine, S. China Sea  Article: As of late, with so many military actions and airstrikes occurring, it almost appears as if we could be seeing the beginning steps of the predicted WWIII. Russian airstrikes are taking place in rebel-controlled parts of Aleppo in the northwestern regions of Syria. As this is occurring we watched as the United States rushed to protect coalition forces from Syrian fighter jets in the northeastern Village known as Hasaka. A city in northeastern Syria has become a flash-point in the countrys civil war as Syrian warplanes attack Kurdish forces Thursday, reports VOA, and the United States responded by sending in its own aircraft to protect U.S. coalition forces in the area. However, according to the Pentagon, Russia states they take no responsibility for the strikes, and in regards to Russia, we made clear that coalition aircraft would defend its troops on the ground it threatened. With the spotlight shining on Russia as of lately, as it recently was revealed that Russia was using an Iranian air base to launch strikes in Aleppo, which would highlight a cooperative military tie between the two countries. Taking this information into consideration, TIME even claimed that there could be a new axis of evil taking place between Russia, Syria, and Iran. Since this information was brought to light, Russia claims they have discontinued use of the Iranian air base. While the story was breaking about U.S jets scrambling in Northeastern Syria, Japan announced that it was seeking a massive upgrade to its F-15 fighters that could double their payload capacity.",1
"Title: The SPLC State...And The Unprecedented Threat To Civil Liberties | Articles  Article: Published in the Social Contract Journal, Spring 2018  The American Constitution utilizes checks and balances to prevent any one faction or person from controlling the State. Yet power over society is not exercised solely through government. Those who favor mass immigration and the abolition of American sovereignty project power from inside and outside the government simultaneously, leveraging law enforcement, the courts, financial institutions, and the media to their ends. And no single group does this better than the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), ostensibly a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) but increasingly becoming a kind of proto-government unto itself. The SPLC is so effective because it exercises power through multiple levels, each building on the other. Because of hate crimes legislation, the political ideology or affiliations of a criminal become highly relevant to any investigation. Though the FBI no longer lists the SPLC on its resources page, it continues to work with the organization to investigate hate crimes. It also trains local law enforcement in how to deal with extremists and hate groups. This begs the question of who constitutes these groups. This is where the SPLCs Intelligence Project comes in, which, as the name implies, serves as a kind of domestic intelligence agency. Political scientist George Michael noted the danger that this poses to civil liberties in Confronting Right-Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA:  The efforts of both NGOs and the government have done much to stymie the threat from the far right in America.... What are the implications of such cooperation between the government and NGOs in this area of public policy?",1
"Title: The Secret Global Reset Agreement  Article: by Preston James By now it has become clear to most VT readers that ISIS was created and trained, and is now supplied and paid by a secret coalition of nations including America, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other smaller but real players. ISIS wounded in battle have been taken to Israel for treatment and some picked up by American Military helicopters. The current head of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, Senator John McCain has been deeply involved in the creation of ISIS and has worked closely with a certain retired American general who is now in a Mideast nation functioning as the Commander of ISIS. Senator McCain was propelled into the power vacuum of our current Administration marked by a President nearing the end of his term who has lost most of his military command ability. Most VT readers know the foreign power that Senator McCain really works for along with almost every other Member of the US Congress because of their Oath to AIPAC. And we know that the real purpose of ISIS has been to destabilize the Mideast, Balkanize Syria and Iran and now Europe with massive immigration. But it was created also to protect the business interests in Israel related to new massive Golan Heights oil finds and a new planned pipeline to supply oil and gas to Europe. We know that another reason for the hiring and deployment of the mercenaries in order to create ISIS was to assist NATO in isolating and weakening the Russian Republic in order to protect Big Oils interests.",1

"Title: Shooting Survivor: CNN Gave Me A Scripted Question After Denying Question Of Armed Guards  Article: This is yet another propaganda alert coming straight from one of the survivors of the Florida school shooting. He says CNN gave him a scripted question after denying him the right to ask about armed guards. According to Real Clear Politics, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Colton Haab said he was approached by CNN to ask a question at Wednesday nights town hall but decided not to after the network gave him a scripted question, and quashing the one he wrote himself. Haab, a member of the Junior ROTC who shielded students while the school was under attack from the shooter, said he was going to ask about using veterans as armed security guards. That doesnt fit CNNs narrative, however, so they disallowed Haab from simply asking his question. CNN had originally asked me to write a speech and questions and it ended up being all scripted, Haab told WPLG-TV. I dont think that its going get anything accomplished. Its not gonna ask the true questions that all the parents and teachers and students have. I expected to be able to ask my questions and give my opinion on my questions, Haab said. Colton Haab, a member of the Junior ROTC who shielded classmates in the midst of terror says he did not get to share his experience, WPLGs Janine Stanwood explained. Colton wrote questions about school safety, suggested using veterans as armed school security guards but claims CNN wanted him to ask a scripted question instead so he decided not to go, Stanwood reported. So what was CNNs response? CNN did not, and does not, script any questions for town hall meetings, ever.

"Title: Take a ride on the crazy train  Article: A state of war exists when there is declared or undeclared military conflict. But this is not the only war. A state of war exists when oppressive authority under color of law and seductive persuasion gradually diminishes our natural rights to life, liberty and property. Today we live in a state of war with the U.S. government. The fact that almost no one is aware is a tribute to the deceptiveness of our political process. Why do most people not feel the oppression of government in spite of so many things that look so obvious to some of us? I can give you one answer and I believe it to be true: The more dependent one is on government authority, the less likely he is to see government and its politicians as an adversary. Another answer is the power that government and its change agents have to manipulate language and stoke class, race and political warfare in order to redirect animus away from government. And if you watch carefully you will see that the government and political class change sides on the issues as they ebb and flow in the national discourse. Thats because the only side the government and political class is on is their own side. And its opposite the peoples side. Nowhere is this more evident than the new debate over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the evil stepchild of the Department of Homeland Security. ICE was formed in 2003 in the aftermath of 9/11 as one of the myriad liberty-stealing laws and government agencies created ostensibly to keep us safe. Keep us safe is one of the many code words politicians and other government men use to oppress us.",1

What struck me about it is the fact that NR has no problem insulting both rural Pennsylvanians and Alabamans by calling Lou Barletta  The Man from Alabama, PA  [National Review, September 18, 2017]  Franklin County is Red America. It's a rural county, about twenty-five miles west of Gettysburg, and it includes the towns of Waynesboro, Chambersburg, and Mercersburg. It was originally settled by the Scotch-Irish, and has plenty of Brethren and Mennonites along with a fast-growing population of evangelicals. The joke that Pennsylvanians tell about their state is that it has Philadelphia on one end, Pittsburgh on the other, and Alabama in the middle. Franklin County is in the Alabama part. It strikes me as I drive there that even though I am going north across the Mason-Dixon line, I feel as if I were going south. The local culture owes more to Nashville, Houston, and Daytona than to Washington, Philadelphia, or New York. One Nation, Slightly Divisible, December 2001  It reminded me of something David Brooks said years ago, when he made a quasi-anthropological study of Red America after the 2000 election.You can see a rebuttal from Missouri farmer Blake Hurst here: The Plains vs. The Atlantic American Enterprise Online ,March 2002. Rural Pennsylvania is not like Alabama for the simple reason that they don't have blacks--in 2000, out of 3.5 million rural Pennsylvanians (as described by the Center For Rural PA ) there were ""157,200 residents, or 5 percent of the total population, who were non-white and/or Hispanic.""",0
"Title: Northern Ireland legislature rejects gay marriageagain  Article: NewsHomosexuality, Politics - U.S. BELFAST, April 30, 2013 (LifeSiteNews.com)  For the second time in a year, the Legislative Assembly of Northern Ireland has rejected attempts to install gay marriage in the province, in a vote of 53 to 42. A similar motion was defeated by 50 votes to 45 last October. Mike Judge, communications director for the Christian Institute said the motion was introduced by Sinn Fein following a decision by the Republic of Ireland to have a referendum on redefining marriage. But the proposal in the Assembly did not give the people of Northern Ireland any say in the matter  and that spoke volumes. But Judge said that the active opposition of Christians both in Northern Ireland and in Britain had a decisive impact. It just shows that the plans to redefine marriage can be defeated when people are prepared to take action, he said. The vote against same-sex marriage will likely cause tension between Northern Irish MPs at Westminster and the efforts by the David Cameron government to force gay marriage into the rest of the country. Following the vote in the House of Commons in February passing the UKs same-sex marriage legislation, it was revealed that of the 13 Northern Ireland MPs, only two voted in favour of changing the definition of marriage and nine against, with two abstaining. The Stormont vote follows a demand by Amnesty International that the province be forced to accept gay marriage though activism in the courts, should the democratic route fail.",0
"Title: Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump  Article: Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. WASHINGTON  Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a message for Donald Trump: Youre wrong, Mr. President. Sessions long has been one of Trumps favorite pinatas, often taking the brunt of the presidents public scorn. Trump offered this assessment of his hand-picked attorney general recusing himself from the Justice Departments special counsel probe of Russian election meddling: What kind of man is this? Trump, in an interview that aired Thursday morning, also blasted Sessions because, he said, the former Alabama senator never took control of the Justice Department. About seven hours later, the countrys top law enforcement officer fired back. And, by doing so, took on Trump publicly in a way few Republicans in Washington have during his turbulent 19-month-old presidency. I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the Presidents agenda  one that protects the safety and security and rights of the American people, reduces violent crime, enforces our immigration laws, promotes economic growth, and advances religious liberty, the AG said in a statement. While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations. I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action, Sessions added.

Barbara and I are finishing up three weeks in Italy, and it's not a happy place. But, for a long time, it hasn't been nearly as happy as most Americans believed. It's a deceptive place, where suffering is usually hidden by tough language, considerable charm, and extraordinary music. Italians are very dramatic, and those who spend time there (Ive been at it for more than fifty years) often wonder if they are on stage or in the audience. Don't forget that, just beneath the apparently cheerful exterior, there has long lurked one of the oldest traditions of political assassination in the world, from Caesar to the mafia. Its always been a tough place, remember that Italy invented fascism. And Hitlers hero and inspiration was Mussolini. There are those who think that there is a fascist revival under way, but I dont see it. I see chaos, populism, and all manner of social and economic programs, the outcome of which is unknowable. As usual, Italy is testing the political waters, as it always has. Its Europes political laboratory. There's a new government, composed of big-talking leaders whose programs call for guaranteed minimum incomes,flat taxes, and much tougher border controls along the country's ocean borders. The latter is highly contentious, and has produced a series of nasty meetings with EU leaders, notably the French. The Italians want other governments, from elsewhere in Europe to North Africa, to shoulder a greater share of the burden.",0

""The fundraiser is for The Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee for Hillary for America, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic committees of 32 states and Puerto Rico"" (fortune.com/...).

Let the people of San Francisco gather and march through the main streets of Nob Hill to protest this event and to show Hillary Clinton that we don't accept this kind of corruption. Rich people should not be allowed to buy politicians. Imagine, for example, how far $30,000 could go to help the homelessness problem in San Francisco. This corruption-fest is not just undemocratic, it is immoral and obscene! The very least we can do is to remind Hillary's rich donors of the corruption they are a part of.

And given what my friend said, I add this: anyone who cares about the unborn can safely vote for Trump because he will attempt to stop the immivasion of pro-abortion Democrat voters. A Catholic can vote for Trump, my friend says, because Trump is a Republican. Being a Republican, he will bring seven or eight thousand people to Washington, many or most of whom will be pro-life. I dont think Trump is pro-abortion, except for the so-called exceptions. But the exceptions are not a federal matter, anyway. Its the states that determine those things.

Turkey, following in Chinas footsteps, filed the complaint after the US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum products coming from the country. Turkey has requested WTO dispute consultations with the United States concerning additional import duties imposed by the United States on steel and aluminum products. The request was circulated to WTO members on 20 August, the WTO said on Monday according to a report by RT. Turkey claims that the measures are inconsistent with a number of provisions of the WTOs Agreement on Safeguards and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, said a statement on the WTOs website. Back in July, the Chinese government lodged a complaint with the WTO over the USs implementation of tariffs on some of their goods. Ankara retaliated against the US by raising tariffs on 22 American-made products ranging from cars to tobacco. According To NPR, the WTO complaint comes less than a week after the Trump administration published a preliminary list of more than 6,000 Chinese products that it wants to hit with an additional 10 percent duty. The list targets products worth a total of $200 billion, ranging from an expansive range of seafood and vegetables to stones, metals, and plywood.

"Title: The dirty truth about so-called family separations at the border  Article: Like nearly every issue of political importance to Americans, the problem of illegal immigration has been buried under such a load of histrionic horse manure that what isnt all that complicated a question is now harder to solve than the Riemann Hypothesis. Thanks to a series of inexplicable policy directions and legal decisions dating back to the 1997 settlement in the case of Flores v. Reno, itself a continuation of Flores v. Meese, we have managed to tie ourselves in a Gordian knot over the question of how to untangle the law on immigration. According to the supporters of immigration policy that would throw open the doors to every Tomas, Ricardo and Jorge who manages to sneak across our southern frontier, President Donald Trump is meeting potential immigrants at the border and literally tearing their children from their arms. The darling little moppets are then warehoused in cages like stray dogs. No one knows what happens to the kiddies next, but their fates probably involve either slavery, forced medical experimentation or outright murder in one of the concentration camps set up under the Trump regime. Its only thanks to the tireless efforts of Hollywood actresses, television comedians and other liberal activists that anyone even learned of Trumps twisted machinations. As for their parents, theyre either summarily executed out back or stuffed into railroad cars and shipped off to fates often worse than death. Of course, like every narrative constructed by the Left, all of that is ridiculous. In accordance with federal law, anyone caught trying to sneak across the border is charged with unlawful entry.",1
"Title: CNNs Chris Cillizza, Along With Peers In The Mainstream Media, Are Rapidly Losing Their Credibility  Article: CNNs Chris Cillizza, along with most of his peers in the mainstream media, are rapidly losing their credibility. They are ignoring the real story at their peril. CNNs Chris Cillizza is absolutely outraged that President Trump would not allow himself to fall into Adam Schiffs obvious trap. The rebuttal memo, intentionally filled with highly sensitive, classified material, was written to provide Adam Schiff with a new opportunity to attack Trump. Schiff and his fellow Democrats were well aware that the rebuttal memo would not be able to be declassified without major redactions to protect sensitive information. He knew that Trump would have to either heavily redact the memo, or not release it. Either scenario would provide Schiff with ammunition. Instead of his administration making the redactions and igniting a political firestorm, Trump chose a third option, the least bad option. He essentially told Schiff to make the necessary changes himself, remove the sources and methods that Schiff railed about prior to the release of the Nunes (which the Nunes memo did not contain, and yes, Schiff had read the document and was very well aware of this fact) and then we can release it. The White House included a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray that says they have identified portions of the Democratic memo that would raise national security or law enforcement concerns if released publicly.",1
"Title: Sober scriptural wisdom on avoiding the whirlwind of lust  Article: OpinionCatholic Church, Faith, Pornography January 27, 2015 (ADW.org) - There is a marvelous chapter in the Book of Proverbs that ought to be studied by every young person who must live in this lustful world. Its sets forth plainly the stance that any son or daughter of God should have regarding the lust so often celebrated by this age. Many preachers and teachers wince at the Book of Proverbs on this topic since it tends to portray seduction and lust as coming from women. However it must be recalled that Proverbs features a father speaking to his son. So the context is that of a young man experiencing seduction from a certain class of women (not all women). The silence of this chapter of Proverbs on the problem of men seducing women should not be taken as a denial of this problem; it is simply not the context of the discussion. Any woman ought to be able to take the advice given here and translate it for her own sake as well. With that in mind lets look at this masterful advice from the Wisdom of God. The alliterations (on the letter D) are based on a talk by Rev. Adrian Rogers that I heard many years ago. While the alliterations are his, the content of this article is wholly mine. I. The Discretion we should follow - 1 My son, be attentive to my wisdom, incline your ear to my understanding; 2 that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge. As we have seen, the Book of Proverbs takes up the form of a father advising his son. One of the most critical roles a father or parent has is to teach and hand on the preserved and tested wisdom that comes to us from God and from experience.",0
"Title: CAIR vs. Ex-Muslim Anni Cyrus  Article: Editor's note: To learn more about Anni Cyrus, visit her site at LiveUpToFreedom.com. The Massachusetts chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) sent out a press release last Friday, calling upon the American Legion Nonantum Post 440 in Newton, Massachusetts to cancel an event featuring Aynaz Anni Cyrus, an ex-Muslim from Iran. Cyrus crime? She knows too much about Islam, and particularly about the institutionalized mistreatment of women under Islamic law, and isnt afraid to speak frankly about what she knows. Said CAIR-MA Executive Director John Robbins: While every American has the right to free speech  even the kind of bigoted and misinformed speech offered by Ms. Cyrus  credible organizations like the American Legion should not provide platforms that imply approval or offer credibility to hate-filled views. CAIR makes similar efforts to shut down any speaker who speaks unwelcome truths about Islam, jihad and Sharia wherever theyre given a mainstream platform, and always claims that these speakers are bigoted and misinformed. When applying these labels to Anni Cyrus, however, CAIR runs into a problem: Cyrus was born in Iran and grew up in the Islamic Republic. Not only was she a Muslim, but she experienced Islam in a nation whose government prides itself on its strict application of Sharia rules. Thus if anyone knows Islam, its Anni Cyrus. Her views are just the opposite of bigoted and misinformed: they were shaped by her own bitter experience. To be sure, the CAIR press release contains a list of inaccurate, defamatory and inflammatory claims about Islam and Muslims that Cyrus has supposedly made, including:  Rape is part of Islam.",1

Personal Liberty Digest presents: The WIRE! Law enforcement announced this week that they had raided a New Mexico compound in which starving children were being tortured into becoming potential school shooters. Oddly, almost none of the media seemed interested in reporting the religious motivations of the monster who ran the place  who has been linked to known Islamofascists and terrorist accomplices like Siraj Wahhaj and Linda Sarsour. Hint: not Quaker. Authorities also announced charges against a previously deported illegal immigrant from Honduras who raped a child after being released by the city of Philadelphia, in keeping with Phillys sanctuary city policy.

The ultimate objective of Research Justice 101: Tools for Feminist Science is to instill in researchers the knowledge of how to practice a socially just science. The event will be organized by Free Radicals, which is described as a Los Angeles-based feminist and anti-racist community organization of scientists[.] The organization aims to incorporate a critical social justice lens into science by way of an interactive workshop on feminist research and engineering practices. According to a description of the event, Justice provides a framework for scientists to think through the hidden assumptions in their methodological approaches, and challenges researchers to think more deeply about the political implications of their work. At the Feminist Science fair, participants will be challenged to apply principles and practices of justice to their own work[.] They will be challenged to ask themselves such questions as: Who benefits? Who is harmed? Who is most vulnerable? The workshop will supply participants with the practical skills and resources needed to push their research communities to be more inclusive, equitable and attentive to social justice.

"Title: Will we bomb Iran for the women?  Article: The American war party continues to itch for an excuse to make war on Iran and has now dusted off an old playbook in its latest effort to get one started. The plan is simple. Foment a seemingly organic round of protests. Create a cause that will pluck at American heartstrings. Use chaos agents, bad actors, agents provocateur and operatives to either instigate violence from the state security apparatus or use violence and procured weapons to make it appear the state security apparatus has begun violent repression. Then employ American media to use video to transmit compelling images relating to the chosen cause and detailing the violent oppressive actions. Sit back and wait for Americans to clamor for government to do something. It worked in Libya, Syria and Ukraine. Will it work in Iran? While the Iran protests that began in the waning days of December seemed to be dying down in recent days, the protest movement may gain some stream today after Friday prayers. These so-called revolutions are pre-planned actions by globalist institutions like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institute, the neocon think tank funded by fascist globalist corporations. In the CFR-linked Project for a New American Century, the war party outlined its plans for manipulating actions in the Middle East and bringing down the regimes in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Iran  among others  and installing puppet regimes back in 2000.

"Title: Never, Ever Threaten the United States Again: President Trump Warns Iranian President To Stop Threats Or Suffer Historic Consequences  Article: I love this man. President Trump has responded to the recent threat made by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during his address to a gathering of Iranian diplomats. The Iran news agency ISNA reports. He said:  Irans power is deterrent and we have no fight or war with anybody but the enemies must understand well that war with Iran is the mother of all wars and peace with Iran is the mother of all peace. We have never been intimidated and will respond threat with threat. Today, speaking with US has no meaning except surrender and end of peoples achievements. Mr. Trump! We are the people of dignity and guarantor of security of the waterway of the region throughout the history. Dont play with the lions tail; you will regret it.

"Title: Donald Trump Signs Anti-Abortion Executive Order  Article: On Monday President Trump signed three executive orders, one of which has the whole United States angry. Trump first signed an executive order formally ending the United States participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, fulfilling one of his core campaign promises. He also signed one freezing federal hiring, and lastly, an executive action to limit abortion funding overseas. Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy, also known as the global gag rule, which was first put in place by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. The action prohibits giving U.S. funding to international nongovernmental organizations that offer or advise on a wide range of family planning and reproductive health options if they include abortion. Annually, the United States spends about $$600 million on international assistance for family planning and reproductive health programs. The regulation has been something of a political football, instituted by Republican administrations and rescinded by Democratic ones since 1984. Most recently, President Barack Obama ended the ban in 2009. Trump signed it one day after the Jan. 22 anniversary of the Supreme Courts 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion in the United States, the date which is traditionally when presidents take action on the policy. The policy also prohibits taxpayer funding for groups that lobby to legalize abortion or promote it as a family planning method. This policy forbids foreign nongovernmental organizations that receive federal funding from performing or promoting abortion services through their work in other countries.",0
"Title: US Attempts To Meddle  Article: Moscow has seen attempts to meddle in the Russian elections coming from the US, a senior Russian diplomat said. It comes as Google is suspected of possibly violating the law by selling political ads for unsanctioned rally. Andrey Nesterenko, a senior Russian diplomat, said the US certainly does attempt to meddle in the Russian electoral processes, Interfax reported. He was speaking after a briefing on the issue. Our collective opinion is that electoral sovereignty is a principle that all civilized nations should respect, the diplomat said, adding that Moscow will notify our American partners that the actions of their media outlets allow us to state that they are close to breaking Russian law. On Sunday, several Russian regions, including Moscow Region, will hold elections. Opposition leader Aleksey Navalny is calling for protests on that day to denounce the planned reform of the pension system, which is currently a hot political topic. Among other ways of spreading the word about the event, Navalnys public movement is using paid ads on Google services such as YouTube.

"Title: Irwin vs. Fletcher on China  Article: (Before It's News) Heres a letter to The Huffington Post: Ian Fletcher writes that What progress against poverty has occurred in the world in recent decades has not been due to free trade, but due to the embrace of mercantilism and industrial policy by some poor nations. According to the World Bank, the entire net global decline in the number of people living in poverty since 1981 has been in mercantilist China, where free trade is spurned (Free Trade Isnt Helping World Poverty, March 19) Overlook the unbelievable claim, allegedly taken from World Bank data (for which Mr. Fletcher offers neither link nor citation), that China alone is responsible for the past 30 years of the globes net decline in number of people living in poverty. Focus instead on Mr. Fletchers assertion that Chinas recent growth is due to that countrys embrace of mercantilism and its spurning of free trade. This assertion is simply wrong. While its true that China  like nearly every other nation on earth  has in place a plethora of growth-inhibiting mercantilist policies, the overwhelming economic story in China over the past 33 years is the liberalization of its markets  a liberalization that includes dramatic reductions in trade barriers. Heres economist Douglas Irwin: In December 1978 China began to end its policy of economic isolation. Under the leadership of Deng Xiaopeng, the government decollectivized agriculture, allowed private entities to trade, and permitted foreign investment.

Since China joined the WTO in 2001, the countrys average tariff will eventually fall to less than 7 percent.* Mr.",0
"Title: Young men giving up on marriage: Women arent women anymore  Article: NewsFamily Fewer young men in the US want to get married than ever, while the desire for marriage is rising among young women, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew recently found that the number of women 18-34 saying that having a successful marriage is one of the most important things rose from 28 percent to 37 percent since 1997. The number of young adult men saying the same thing dropped from 35 percent to 29 percent in the same time. Pews findings have caught the attention of one US writer who maintains that feminism, deeply entrenched in every segment of the culture, has created an environment in which young men find it more beneficial to simply opt out of couple-dom entirely. Suzanne Venkers article, The War on Men, which appeared on the website of Fox News in late November, has become a lodestone for feminist writers who have attacked her position that the institution of marriage is threatened, not enhanced, by the supposed gains of the feminist movement over the last 50 years. Where have all the good (meaning marriageable) men gone? is a question much talked about lately in the secular media, Venker says, but her answer, backed up by statistics, is not to the liking of mainstream commentators influenced by feminism. STORY: My father raped his daughter. And I am their baby. My story. She points out that for the first time in US history, the number of women in the workforce has surpassed the number of men, while more women than men are acquiring university degrees. The problem?

"Title: Once Again Our Islamist President Uses His Authority to Cut Military Pay  Article: Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE Obama has for the second year in row used his executive powers to put a cap on pay raises for our loyal armed forces Once Again Our Islamist President Uses His Authority to Cut Military Pay Its just not right for the President of the United States to be a lap dog for any foreign entity and even more so if that favored group is a terrorist inclined quasi religious gathering of foreigners who are anti-American at heart. This current occupant of our Oval Office fits that description totally. Obama has for the second year in row used his executive powers to put a cap on pay raises for our loyal armed forces and is repeating the mistakes of past administrations that were intent on degrading and insulting to our military by not allowing legitimate pay increases. According to a letter from the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) dated September 5, 2014 an active duty pay raise is determined by private sector wage growth, measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI calls for a 1.8 percent pay raise in 2015. According to the MOAA letter, From 2000 to 2012, Congress worked hard to eliminate a 13.5 percent military pay gap with the private sector caused by repeatedly capping military raises in the 1980s and 90s. But the restoration of military pay comparability with the private sector is under threat.

"Title: American Citizen Found Guilty Of Helping Al-Qaida Launch Suicide Attack Against US Base  Article: American citizen Muhanad Mahmoud Al Farekh was found guilty Friday of helping al-Qaida plan a car attack on a U.S. military base in Afghanistan. Jurors found Farekh guilty of supporting a foreign terrorist organization, conspiring to murder Americans and using a weapon of mass destruction, Reuters reports. Today, an American al-Qaeda member was brought to justice in a U.S. courtroom, said Bridget Rohde, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Two vehicles full of bombs hit Forward Operating Base Chapman in Afghanistan Jan. 19, 2009, and the ensuing explosion killed one Afghan and injured several others. But the larger bombs failed to detonate because the second car crashed as a result of the explosion from the first car, leaving Americans totally unscathed. Farekhs fingerprints were found on the bomb that never exploded. Prosecutors stated that Farekh began watching al-Qaida propaganda videos and was partly radicalized by sermons from Anwar al-Awlaki, who the CIA killed in 2011. As such, he plotted with two other students at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, to join the terrorist organization and flew to Pakistan in 2007, serving in al-Qaidas external operations unit until 2014. All of these charges together mean that Farekh, who is originally from Houston, is staring down life in prison when it comes time for his sentencing Jan. 11. Interestingly, Farekh almost didnt have the opportunity to face the possibility of life in prison, as U.S. officials, specifically officials in the CIA, were pushing to authorize a drone strike against him, but ultimately the Obama administration decided against the plan in favor of capture.",1

"Title: #MeToo: Female Sexual Assault Accuser Settles With Her Own Accuser Following Allegations of Sexual Assault  Article: OK, I know, settling with someone doesn't necessarily imply that the person is guilty. Sometimes it is simply to get it out of the media's sights, especially when you are in the spotlight. However, I find it ironic that Italian actress and #MeToo champion Asia Argento, who was one of the first to come forward and accuser movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, has now settled a sexual assault allegation brought against her for $380,000. The New York Times reports:  But in the months that followed her revelations about Mr. Weinstein last October, Ms. Argento quietly arranged to pay $380,000 to her own accuser: Jimmy Bennett, a young actor and rock musician who said she had sexually assaulted him in a California hotel room years earlier, when he was only two months past his 17th birthday. She was 37. The age of consent in California is 18. That claim and the subsequent arrangement for payments are laid out in documents between lawyers for Ms. Argento and Mr. Bennett, a former child actor who once played her son in a movie. The documents, which were sent to The New York Times through encrypted email by an unidentified party, include a selfie dated May 9, 2013, of the two lying in bed. As part of the agreement, Mr. Bennett, who is now 22, gave the photograph and its copyright to Ms. Argento, now 42. Three people familiar with the case said the documents were authentic. The Times has tried repeatedly since Thursday to get a response to the matter from Ms. Argento and her representatives. She did not reply to messages left on her phone, sent by email and sent to two of her agents, who agreed to forward it to her.",1

"Title: DNA Evidence Exonerates Edward Thompson Confessed Serial Murderer And Rapist, Thompson States I Took The Blame So African-American Youths Wouldnt Be Punished!  Article: By Werombi Towradji After spending nearly 35 years behind bars in a federal prison, recently analyzed DNA evidence has exonerated confessed serial murderer and rapist Edward Thompson. The evidence proves conclusively that the crimes for which he took responsibility were, in fact, committed by African-Americans. Thompson, a white male, who is 58 now, was serving eight consecutive life sentences. One for each victim. In a trial that lasted several months, prosecutors showed the jury pictures of brutally beaten, raped, tortured, and murdered young women. For years Thompson was regarded as one of Americas most heinous serial killers, and his story was profiled extensively by the media. Many Americans were puzzled as to why a young white American, who was by all accounts a great student, from a wealthy and upper class family, would go into urban neighbourhoods and brutally rape and murder young white women. His family and friends expressed disbelief, yet in court, he confessed guilt and even orated at length as to how much he enjoyed planning and carrying out his horrific crimes. It was all, we know now, a carefully contrived act. Upon his release, reporters asked Thompson, Why did you accept guilt for such heinous and gruesome crimes when you were innocent? Why did you keep silent for so many years, and remain in prison? Thompson answered I knew that most likely these crimes were going to be traced to urban youths of color. I didnt want African-American boys, who grew up facing the sting of poverty and bigotry everyday of their lives, to go to jail for raping and killing a series of privileged and affluent white women. The truth is we are all guilty.",0

The group being released will be drawn from those held at Guantanamo  who include an accused senior al Qaeda bomb-maker, the terror groups top financial manager, and two intended 9/11 hijackers, who have all been held in the Cuba-based U.S. detention facility for more than a decade. According to a military source briefed on the process, 22 detainees are being prepared for transfer out of the camp, also known as Gitmo, before January 20. Although the White House has not specified which inmates will be transferred out  or which foreign countries have agreed to accept them  it has indicated that this will be a priority for Obama in his final days in office. I cant speak to any individual notifications that have been made to Congress or give you a specific preview about upcoming transfers, said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. I think I would expect at this point additional transfers to be announced before January 20th. Obama will likely focus on moving the 23 detainees who have been cleared for transfer  a group that includes the alleged head of al Qaedas bomb-manufacturing operation in eastern Afghanistan, the head of al Qaedas Tunisian faction in Afghanistan, and senior weapons trainers. Those held in Guantanamo in recent years have been dubbed the worst of the worst by military and intelligence officials.",1
"Title: The WIRE: Your week in review  Article: From the Vegas Strip to the Sunset Strip  and most points in between  its time for a look back at the week that was. Personal Liberty Digest presents: The WIRE! The anti-Bill of Rights vultures could barely contain their glee over the terrorist attack in Las Vegas. However, their leading messengers were more noteworthy than their message. The liberal idea of a serious debate is the fourth funniest host of The Man Show. As usual, progressives lined up to blame the NRA. And, as usual, they were all so very, very, wrong. Murders committed   Planned Parenthood: Approximately 60 million since 1973. The NRA: 0. Ever. Liberals did get to learn a whole new thing to not understand. Bump stocks? What NRA-owned, rethuglikkkan, scumbag signed off on letting those be legal? Did you know an assault rifle can fire between 400 and 800 rounds a minute? Noted firearms experts Senator Dianne Feinstein and celebutante Kim Kardashian both reminded fans of that this week. And they would know; one of them even made a sex tape! At least, I hope only one of them did. Among the misinformation spread by feverish Democrats this week: Any civilian can buy a machine gun, no questions asked, over the internet; they sell automatic rounds at gun shows, and something called gun silencers exists. Im surprised they didnt claim Stephen Paddock got hold of a phased plasma rifle in the 40 watt range. Phased plasma rifles dont kill people. Cyberdyne Model 101 T-800s kill people. Gun-grabbers also cant figure out what happens if firearms are restricted to government use only. Broke: All cops are brutal, racist, pigs! Woke: Only cops should have guns!",1

"Title: Trump Exposed Sabotaging Already Fragile U.K. Relations With Highly Petty Demands  Article: Donald Trump cast himself as a supposedly amazing deal maker while coming into office, promising to restore Americas position in the world, but in reality, hes only caused our position in the world to worsen in the minds of many. Instead of the respected leader we once were, under the Trump administration, the United States  at least its government  has devolved into even more of an apparent laughingstock than it was before. A new report from Bloomberg outlines just how such has come about in the case of our relationship with the United Kingdom. According to the publication, Trump hasnt limited his whining about the treatment he receives from the press to his public statements, including those offered on Twitter. Rather, according to Bloomberg, during a phone conversation with British Prime Minister Theresa May last year, Trump went so far as to complain to the British leader about the negative coverage of him in the British press. He apparently insisted at the time that he wouldnt be accepting the U.K.s offer of a state visit unless May could assure him that he would receive a warm welcome.",0
"Title: Spain Bucks the Happiness Trend  Article: By Delusional Economics, who is determined to cleanse the daily flow of vested interests propaganda to produce a balanced counterpoint. Cross posted from MacroBusiness. Market and real economic divergence continues apace in the European periphery and, much like Italy, Spain is again showing worrying signs that further fiscal tightening is creating far more severe negative consequences than expected. The deterioration in the economy is once again leading to a re-assessment of targets: European Union budget enforcer Olli Rehn signaled he might seek to ease Spains targets for cutting its budget deficit in a retreat from the demands that helped drive the economy into recession. EU officials will make a decision on the best pace for Spains budget consolidation when they deliver a scheduled assessment of the program in February, Rehn said at a press conference in Madrid yesterday. If there has been a serious deterioration in the economy, we can propose an extension of a countrys adjustment path, said Rehn, the EUs economic and monetary affairs commissioner, as he sat alongside Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos. Thats what we did last year in the case of Spain. But it isnt just the national government that is struggling under re-newed economic retrenchment. Regional governments are also in economic trouble and requesting life-lines from the state: The regional government of Catalonia on Tuesday formally requested 9 billion euros ($12 billion) from a rescue fund created by Spain to save its financially beleaguered regions.",0
"Title: Unnecessary Loss of Life  Article: War is nasty, brutal and costly. In our latest wars, many of the casualties suffered by American troops are a direct result of their having to obey rules of engagement created by politicians who have never set foot on  or even seen  a battlefield. Today's battlefield commanders must be alert to the media and do-gooders who are all too ready to demonize troops involved in a battle that produces noncombatant deaths, so-called collateral damage. According to a Western Journalism article by Leigh H Bravo, ""Insanity: The Rules of Engagement"" (http://tinyurl.com/p59nlqs), our troops fighting in Afghanistan cannot do night or surprise searches. Also, villagers must be warned prior to searches. Troops may not fire at the enemy unless fired upon. U.S. forces cannot engage the enemy if civilians are present. And only women can search women. Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney said: ""We handcuffed our troops in combat needlessly. This was very harmful to our men and has never been done in U.S combat operations that I know of."" Collateral damage and the unintentional killing of civilians are a consequence of war. But the question we should ask is: Are our troops' lives less important than the inevitable collateral damage? The unnecessary loss of life and casualties that result from politically correct rules of engagement are about to be magnified in future conflicts by mindless efforts to put women in combat units. In 2013, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta officially lifted the ban on women serving in ground combat roles. On Jan. 1, 2016, all branches of the military must either open all positions to women or request exceptions.",0

Vivre dans la Dignit(Living with Dignity), a grassroots group network that officially launches its campaign on Tuesday, says that Quebecers must tell the Charest government that euthanasia and assisted suicide must be rejected as unnecessary and dangerous. Euthanasia and assisted suicide are killing, plain and simple. We cannot allow killing to be confused with health care in Quebec, said Linda Couture, director of Living with Dignity. Couture said the provincial government must direct its efforts and resources to offering Quebecers the best possible end of life care, including ready access to palliative care, rather than encouraging euthanasia and assisted suicide just to save money.

"Title: The cure for toxic masculinity is real masculinity  Article: This article was originally published on FEE.org. Read the original article. Since the #MeToo phenomenon hit, I have started asking my female friends directly about their everyday experiences with men. For example, what proportion of men that they meet on a dating app send utterly inappropriate communications, and how often in everyday life does a guy disrespect them in a way thats overtly or implicitly sexual? While I am sure that my circle of male friends isnt fully representative of the population of men at large, I was shocked to discover from my unscientific survey how many men have no clue about how to behave. Based on the combined responses of several women I trust, the number of men who say or do something offensive to a woman they dont know on a dating app, almost right out of the gate, may be just shy of a majority. And many a young woman can, if you ask her, relate tales of men making inappropriate remarks, shouting out of a car window as she walks down the street, whipping out his genitalia after one too many drinks, or being opportunistically crude at a coffee shop, even as she sits there with a very young child. (These were all stories I was told.) For some young women, these things seem to happen on a more or less monthly basis. My recent conversations with female friends about the matter has led me to this question: what the hell is wrong with these men, and why are there so many of them? What has happened to men? To me, this is not a question about sexual harassment. Its a more fundamental one: an old-fashioned idea called manners.",0
"Title: Researchers conclude: Proxima B has OCEANS and may well harbour ALIEN LIFE  Article: According to researchers, the second Earth, aka Proxima B has vast oceans covering its surface and may harbor alien life. Experts from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) concluded that it si very likely that the rocky planet discovered in the habitable zone of its star is covered by oceans. Researchers discovered Proxima B in August and believe it is the first exoplanet that is within our reach. The alien world is located just over 4 light-years from Earth. It is believed to have a mass 1.4 times that of Earth and orbits its host star at a distance of 7.5 million kilometers, which is one-tenth of the distance between Mercury and our Sun, or 5 percent the distance between our planet and the Sun. Proxima B takes just 11.2 days to complete an orbit around its host star. Contrary to what one might expect, such proximity does not necessarily mean that Proxima Bs surface is too hot for water to exist in liquid form, said a CNRS statement. The Host Star Proxima Centauriis smaller and around 1000 times weaker when compared to our sun.",0
"Title: San Francisco afraid to enforce buffer zone ordinance; Planned Parenthood ticked  Article: The PulseAbortion, Freedom In the aftermath of the Supreme Courts June 26 decision striking down Massachusetts 35-foot buffer zone law, the City of San Francisco has become squishy about enforcing its buffer zone ordinance, ticking off Planned Parenthood in the process. San Franciscos ordinance, which bans abortion opponents from entering a 25-foot line of demarcation around abortion clinics, is virtually identical to Massachusetts now voided law, minus 10 feet. Now, San Francisco pro-life activists are allegedly feeling their oats and defying the ordinance by crossing the line. Meanwhile, city attorneys are rightfully worried that enforcing the ordinance will draw pro-life ire and a lawsuit. So theyve chosen instead to withstand pro-abortion ire by ignoring the pro-life provocateurs, which has resulted in a letter of complaint from Planned Parenthood. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, July 27: Planned Parenthood executives say San Francisco police and the city attorney arent doing enough to protect patients and staff from harassment and intimidation at the organizations health center on Valencia Street [pictured above]. Each week, as the harassment and intimidation escalate the citys ordinances are violated ever more flagrantly, Planned Parenthoods Bay Area chapter leader, Heather Saunders Estes,wrote in a July 22 letter to City Attorney Dennis Herrera. And when center staffers call police, they are told that there is nothing they can do, Saunders Estes wrote. The protesters now ignore San Franciscos 25-foot buffer zone as they pass out literature, and film staffers and patients entering the building, clinic reps complain.",0

Sen. Mike Lee, R-UT, said that the fight isn't over, and that ""it's wrong for these decisions to be made by federal judges. "" Lee was responding to comments by his colleague, Utah's senior U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch, a seven-term Republican. On Wednesday, Hatch made national news for saying that ""the trend right now in the courts is to permit gay marriage, and anybody who doesn't admit that just isnt living in the real world."" He said while he doesn't think that's the right way to go...I do accept whatever the courts say. "" Lee said the courts were the wrong venue for decisions about marriage, and policies should be made by the states. ""They shouldn't be thrust upon the states by federal judges who aren't elected. They're not accountable to anyone who is elected,"" he said. Lee told a local ABC affiliate that he supports Utah's marriage amendment, which was approved by two-thirds of voters in 2004.

Such is the case with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Before you blast me, hear me out. Most of you who read what I write know I'm not a liberal. So, if anyone wants to bash me as such, you are doing so knowing you are misrepresenting me. Has Jeff Sessions done some good things? Of course! He's taken a verbal stand for the Constitution when it comes to authorization for war. Of course, he failed to actually bring any resolve in the matter. He's also overseen a lot of enforcement of both immigration law and child pornography and human trafficking arrests. However, let me lay out a specific case in which Jeff Sessions, a proponent of unconstitutional asset forfeiture, speaks regarding free speech. First, consider a recent speech by Sessions in which he warned about the Supreme Court's ruling concerning unconstitutional ""free speech zones,"" whatever those are. Following the speech, I'll demonstrate the hypocrisy that is going one. Here's the speech. Thank you for that kind introduction.

"Title: PLO Terrorists Won't Let Us Mediate, Will Take Our $$$  Article: Bad news. The Islamic terrorist group we fund won't let us mediate the non-existent peace process that they've rejected and walked away from every time and under every previous president. I don't know what we'll do now. But it'll probably involve giving them more money (thanks to everyone who neutered the Taylor Force Act) and trying to negotiate an impossible peace with them anyway. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told an international summit Wednesday that the United States was unfit to mediate the Mideast conflict, marking a major policy shift after decades spent courting American goodwill. But there is a role for the US in giving Abbas hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Sometimes the PLO reminds me of a murderous brat. ""I'm not gonna talk to you dad, but you still have to pay for everything."" I have a modest proposal. It involves not funding terrorists. Especially snotty terrorists. Abbas said Trumps decision was a crime, which came at a time when the Palestinians were engaged with Washington in a new push to reach a long-elusive peace agreement with Israel, the deal of our times. Instead we got the slap of our times, Abbas said. The United States has chosen to lose its qualification as a mediator ... We will no longer accept that it has a role in the political process. He suggested the U.N. should take over as mediator. That sounds like a plan. The UN and the PLO should mediate negotiations over which of them hates Jews more. The summit of the 57-member Organization of Muslim Cooperation concluded with the so-called Istanbul Declaration, outlining the blocs response to Trumps declaration.",0
"Title: Canadian Police State vs. Brad Love  Article: By Paul Fromm TORONTO, CanadaThe decade-long saga of state persecution of inveterate Canadian letter-writer Brad Love reached a new low November 28 when he was criminally charged for writing a letter to his own lawyer. While many of his fellow prisoners were passing the time watching TV or semi-comatose on the medications freely ladled out by the authorities, Love prefers to read and write. But Americas neighbor to the north cant have that. Its better to be a compliant zombie than a dissident thinker in politically-correct Canada. Loves incoming mail was held up for more than a month, and he has been informed he is not allowed to write to anyone. Years after his conviction in 2002 under Canadas notorious hate law for writing non-threatening letters to public officials criticizing Canadas immigration mess, Love is still mired in the toils of repression. In March 2009, Love was arrested by eight armed detectives at a Toronto free speech meeting for sending some information packages to four Toronto Jewish groups. In July 2012, after 10 court appearances, requiring travel from Alberta, time off work and loss of wages, Love was sentenced to a further 18 months in prison, plus a further three-year gag order from writing letters to the media or politicians. He has called his ordeal an abuse by process. He has applied for bail, pending an appeal. In July 2013, his bail was arbitrarily revoked, so for the past five months he has languished in jail, again for nothing more than the non-violent expression of his populist, no-nonsense, working-guy views.

"Title: Fire Brigades Union Takes First Step to Industrial Action Ballot  Article: Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! LONDON, ENGLAND(Marketwire  Sept. 14, 2011) - The Fire Brigades Union has told Ministers in the Government and devolved administrations to deliver fair pensions in the fire service and reject Whitehall plans for fire crews to pay more, work longer and get less. It is the first step towards balloting the unions 43,000 members across the UK. The plans also propose increasing pension contributions by between 3.2% and 6%, a move which will cost fire crews between 2,000 and 7,500 by 2014. Fire crews in the main pension scheme face the highest payments in the public sector, up from 11% to 14.2% for firefighters and 17% for fire officers who have taken promotion. The higher tier contributions increases of up to 6% start kicking in for thousands of junior officers based at fire stations from station managers upwards. The union described the increases as a tax on fire crews as part of a smash and grab raid on their pensions to help pay off the budget deficit. This deficit was triggered by the near collapse of the banks and the need for huge public borrowing to fund the bank bail out. The union has warned the increases will see an exodus from the pension scheme which relies on contributions coming in to pay the pensions going out.",0

"Title: Now In Effect: Sweeping Vermont Privacy Law Will Hinder Several Federal Surveillance Programs  Article: By Mike Maharrey A sweeping new law that establishes robust privacy protections in Vermont went into effect today. It not only limits warrantless surveillance and helps ensure electronic privacy in the Green Mountain State, it will also hinder several federal surveillance programs that rely on cooperation and data from state and local law enforcement. The new law bans warrantless use of stingray devices to track the location of phones and sweep up electronic communications, restricts the use of drones for surveillance by police, and generally prohibits law enforcement officers from obtaining electronic data from service providers without a warrant or a judicially issued subpoena. Sen. Tim Ashe, Sen. Joe Benning and Sen. Dick Sears prefiled Senate Bill 155 (S.155) in December. As filed, the legislation addressed the use of drones by Vermont law enforcement, and placed some additional limits on storage and sharing of data collected by ALPRs. An amendment in a Senate committee added provisions to limit warrantless collection of electronic data. Amendments in the House banned the warrantless use of stingray devices and ultimately put off significant changes to current ALPR law. Gov. Shumlin signed S.155 into law on June 6. It went into effect in stages. Extension of the current ALPR statue went into effect immediately, along with study requirements. Minor changes to current ALPR law took effect July 1. Sections relating to drones, stingrays and warrantless data collection become effective today. STINGRAYS The new law virtually bans the use of cell site simulators, known as stingrays.",1

Andrew Whitmore, 44, woke up in incredible pain and soaked in blood in his exs apartment and realized only moments later what had really happened. He had been drugged and his ex-girlfriend had tattooed her face all over his chest, arms, legs, back, posterior and even on his genitals.

"" In its request, DHS/CBP said ""The system should be capable and deployable across all environments throughout the southwest and Northern Border.

We will call the technology that could do the job --- the Canadian Border Assessment and Reporting Technology, or CABARET. CABARET would consist of two main elements --- the SEIDARM sensor system and the HERMES drone system. SEIDARM --- Seismic Detection and Ranging Mechanism --- employs off-the-shelf seismic oil exploration hardware, including geophones, cables and seismographs, with some minor modifications. The difference lies in the processing of the data. Oil companies acquire seismic data to be analyzed at a later date. SEIDARM analyses the data in real time, on-site.

This is false. If this were true, State could list the terror incidents on American soil that Iran sponsored. They do not, because they cannot. If there were such a list showing the guilt of Iran in causing terrorist acts in America, the U.S. would long ago have declared war on Iran. The closest Washington can come to blaming Iran for a terror event in America is the incident involving the plan to assassinate the Saudi ambassador. The participation of Irans government in that affair is highly contested. We keep getting mass murder attacks on American soil, some of which are terror attacks. List one is here. List two is here. List three, a shorter list that focuses only on radical Islamist attacks during Obamas 8 years, is here. How many of these attacks trace back to Iran? NONE. ZERO. None of the 13 attacks in List 3 are even remotely linked to Iran. List 1 doesnt supply enough data to determine affiliations of terrorists without further research. List 2 is a long Wiki list.

"Title: Video report confirms Egyptian crucifixions  Article: An Arabic-language video news report from Abu Dhabi-based Sky News Arabia confirms a WND story about the latest method of attack on Christians in Egypt: crucifixions. The story went viral over the weekend, but today columnist Jonathan Kay at Canadas National Post described it as a hoax and an instant Internet myth. It is, of course, theoretically possible that Muslim radicals truly have crucified someone, somewhere, sometime, in Egypt. Islamist mobs have staged countless murderous attacks on Copt infidels in recent years  and a crucifixion would hardly be more barbarous tactic than truck bombs and beheadings, he wrote. But the story doesnt just allege that a crucifixion has taken place somewhere in Egypt, he added: It alleges that multiple crucifixions have taken place in front of the presidential palace. That would be the equivalent of, say, mass lynchings taking place in front of the White House, or a giant gang rape taking place in front of Ottawas Centennial Flame fountain. Most damning, according to Kays column, is that one of the key sources cited by WND for the story  an Arabic-language report by Sky News  doesnt exist. There is no Sky report on the subject, he wrote. Except there is.",0
"Title: Meet FireChat  How Hong Kong Protesters are Communicating Without the Internet  Article: Support #altnews & keep Dark Politricks alive Remember I told you over 5 years ago that they would be trying to shut down sites and YouTube channels that are not promoting the ""Official"" view. Well it's happening big time. Peoples Channels get no money from YouTube any more and Google is being fishy with their AdSense giving money for some clicks but not others. The time is here, it's not ""Obama's Internet Cut Off Switch"" it's ""Trumps Sell Everyones Internet Dirty Laundry Garage Sale"". It's not just Google/YouTube defunding altenative chanels (mine was shut), but Facebook is also removing content, shutting pages, profiles and groups and removing funds from #altnews that way as well. I was recently kicked off FB and had a page ""unpublished"" with no reason given. If you don't know already all Facebooks Private Messages and Secret Groups are still analysed and checked for words related to drugs, sex, war etc against their own TOS. Personally IU know there are undercover Irish police moving from group to group cloning peoples accounts and getting people booted. Worse than that I know people in court at the moment for the content they had on their secret private group. Use Telegrams secret chat mode to chat on, or if you prefer if you need to or buy a dumb phone with nothing for the NSA to hack into if you are that paranoid. So if your not supporting this site already which brings you news from the Left to the Right (really the same war mongering bollox) then I could do with some. Even if it's just 5 or tick the monthly subscription box it will be much appreciated. Read on to find out why/ Why? Any support to keep this site would be appreciated.",0
"Title: Orange Crushed: John Boehner Melts Down After President Obama Vetoes Keystone XL %%  Article: Speaker of the House John Boehner could only react with inept rage after President Obama vetoed Keystone XL. In a statement, Boehner raged: The presidents veto of the Keystone jobs bill is a national embarrassment. Its embarrassing when Russia and China are plowing ahead on two massive pipelines and we cant get this one no-brainer of a project off the ground. The president is just too close to environmental extremists to stand up for Americas workers. Hes too invested in left-fringe politics to do what presidents are called on to do, and thats put the national interest first. For the president, Keystone may just be todays politics, but there are workers and unions who have spent years counting on the 42,000 jobs this project will support. There are small business owners counting on the promise and opportunities this project will bring to their towns. There are governors in both parties counting on the revenue and growth this project will bring to their states. There are manufacturers clamoring for the development of North Americas resources. And theres an overwhelming majority of Americans who want us to put politics aside and get this done. Everyone who pays attention to politics understood that the Republican obsession with Keystone XL was a total waste of time. It is interesting that Boehner considers the veto of the pipeline a national embarrassment when he doesnt feel the same way about the government shutdown that he spearheaded, the various debt ceiling debacles, the invasion of Iraq based on a lie that he supported, and House of Representatives that spends more time on vacation than passing laws. The national embarrassment is John Boehner.",1
"Title: Turkish PMs Visit to Iraq May Give Impetus to 'Fight Against Daesh'  Article: Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim had a two-day visit to Baghdad and Erbil over the weekend. Sputnik spoke in an interview with the Deputy Chairman of the parliamentary faction of the ruling Turkish Justice and Development Party (AKP) Bulent Turan regarding the visit and its effect on the fight against terrorists in the region. Looking at the whole picture, I want to say that our recent visits to Baghdad and Erbil have been very successful and yielded more positive results than was originally expected. Iraq is our neighbor, with which Turkey has long-standing close social, cultural and historical relations, Turan said. He further said Turkey wants to work more closely with all its neighboring countries and above all with Iraq . The two countries have much work to do in the economic and political sphere as well as establish cooperation in the field of security. According to Turan, the official visit of the Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, ministers and deputies as part of the Turkish delegation for two days was carried out in close contact with the Iraqi authorities and that resulted in signing of several mutual agreements. We see that Iraq needs us and we need it.",0
"Title: The Vatican is Coming After Humanae Vitae: Time to Fight Back  Article: The memorandum states that the commission is to promote a comprehensive and authoritative study of the encyclical to coincide with its fiftieth anniversary this summer. Mr. Pentin then goes on to give observations of the theological bent of the commissions four members which is less than encouraging. On September 11, 2017 Edward Pentin penned an article for the National Catholic Register entitled,  Humanae Vitae Comes Under Fire . In that article he stated, that recent developments in Rome indicate a campaign is underway to challenge the encyclicals prohibition against artificial contraception. Evidence includes the revealing of a formerly secret commission tasked by the Vatican, with the Popes approval, to study Humanae Vitae. The commission was discovered only through an Italian website obtaining a classified memorandum from the Vatican Secretary of State referring to it. Mr. Pentin writes:  Before his death on Sept. 6, Cardinal Carlo Caffarra had privately expressed similar grave concerns about the commission. Like others, he believed the opening of the archives was a ploy to obtain selected findings and then present them to show that Paul VIs commission was moving in the direction of loosening the Churchs teaching on contraception, but undue pressure was placed on the Pope to reassert the doctrine. Another expected strategy by commission members and other revisionists is to present any re-interpretations as part of a change in paradigm in moral theology, just as was achieved with Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love) in allowing for some civilly remarried divorcees to receive Holy Communion.",0
