"Title: New Audio From The Night Of The Las Vegas Massacre Reveals That There Was Another Active Shooter In The Bar At The Top Of The Mandalay Bay Hotel During The Attack  Article: Newly released audio from the Clark County Fire Department has provided even more proof that there were multiple shooters during The Las Vegas Massacre, further debunking the official narrative of a lone gunman on the 32nd floor and once again calling into question almost every aspect of what actually happened during the worst mass shooting in American history. The audio, released on the SoundCloud account of a local news reporter, is an almost three hour recording of transmissions between dispatch and units on the ground amid the confusion of the mass shooting that at one point details a report that a wife of a firefighter was actually pinned down in the Foundation Room bar on top of the Mandalay Hotel. Intellihubs Shepard Ambellas, who has extensively reported on the entire Vegas cover-up since the beginning, recently found that at around the 1:27:54 mark of the audio file you can clearly hear dispatch describing the situation to first responders who are headed in that direction. We have a firefighters wife at this event who is pinned down behind the bar at Mandalay Bay. We are trying to get further on the name, dispatch frantically notes. Batallion 6, be advised that we are getting reports on Mandalay Bay, at the bar, we currently have, another active shooter up there. After being asked to confirm the information, dispatch goes on to make clear that she is specifically speaking about the bar at the top of the hotel rather than anywhere near the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock supposedly operated from.",0
"Title: Insurers Blame Trump For ObamaCare Premiums Skyrocketing  Article: Washington state and New York released projections Monday that revealed insurers in their individual markets are seeking to raise premiums dramatically. As Obamacare premiums continue to skyrocket, insurance companies are blaming president Donald Trump for the price hike citing the removal of the individual mandate. Theres still a great deal of uncertainty in individual markets across the country, fueled by the Trump administrations efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, Washington insurance commissioner Mike Kreidler said in a statement. Instead of getting behind solutions that shore up these markets, the administration seems solely focused on undermining our health insurance system and the individuals and families who need to buy their coverage in the individual market. Well, thats not exactly what removing the individual mandate did. Lets call a spade a spade, shall we? The individual mandate was a government dictate demanding that all Americans purchase health insurance that was the right kind of insurance as determined by the government. So because people are no longer forced to purchase their product at gunpoint or under threats of extortion, the insurance companies are throwing a fit and punishing those who still buy their product. Supporters of the individual mandates repeal cite the drastic increase in premiums that hit prior to repeal in making the case that the system was inefficient long before the Trump administration introduced greater uncertainty.",1

By Lisa Haven Have you ever pondered the idea that the America you live in, is just not the America you once knew? Well, there is a reason for that and it starts with the United Nationsa global organization whose goal it is to rule the world. In fact in the video Ive compiled below, I prove with 100% facts that the United Nations is doing just that, and how they have infiltrated every continent and specifically every state here in America. Furthermore I prove they have their hands in our school systems and multiple colleges all pushing a global agenda. When America finally meets her full demise, it will be because we collapsed from within and then the New World Order will implement its full blow.

"Title: Former Beatle Ringo Starr Claims the Real Paul McCartney Died in 1966 and Was Replaced by Look-Alike  Article: Beverly Hills | The former drummer of the Beatles, Ringo Starr, surprised the world this morning during an interview in his luxurious Californian residence when he admitted that the 45-year old rumors about the alleged death of Paul McCartney in 1966 were actually true. In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Mr. Starr explained that the real Paul McCartney had died in a car crash on November 9, 1966, after an argument during a Beatles recording session. To spare the public from grief, the Beatles replaced him with a man named William Shears Campbell, who was the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest and who happened to have the same kind of jovial personality as Paul. When Paul died, we all panicked! claims Ringo, obviously very emotional. We didnt know what to do, and Brian Epstein, our manager, suggested that we hire Billy Shears as a temporary solution. It was supposed to last only a week or two, but time went by and nobody seemed to notice, so we kept playing along. Billy turned out to be a pretty good musician and he was able to perform almost better than Paul. The only problem was that he couldnt get along with John, at all. William Shears Campbell, better known as Billy Shears, does indeed disappear  from records in 1966 and no traces of him can be found after Pauls alleged death. Mr. Starr alleges that the group did send out a lot of hidden messages through the years to prepare the population for the truth. He notably says that the entire Sgt.",0
"Title: Heroic Effort By Virginia's Corey Stewart Shows Nationalism Lives  Article: It was agonizingly close, but populist candidate and Trump supporter Corey Stewart lost to useless consultantcuck Ed Gillespie in the Virginia gubernatorial primary. Gillespie is of course one of the worst candidates who has ever lived , practically a caricature of a GOP Establishment type. But his money and endorsements ultimately overcame Stewart, who campaigned hard on the need to protect Confederate monuments. Interestingly, Gillespie reportedly took up the Confederate cause at the last minute. [No, Ed Gillespie Doesnt Support Removing Confederate Monuments, Gillespie Campaign, June 12, 2017] This last minute pandering may have saved him. Gillespie was running 11th hour digital ads promising republicans that he would fight to protect Confederate monuments. https://t.co/y4LoCF6YGY  Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) June 14, 2017  The people who should be especially frustrated are Trump supporters. Stewart was a fanatical defender of President Trump during the campaign as Virginia State Chairman, memorably championing the Republican candidate even when the party turned on him after the Access Hollywood tape. Stewart was fired for his trouble but still backed Trump. Now, because Donald Trump remained silent, Stewart was narrowly defeated in a primary he could have won. And instead, an Open Borders, PC, GOP Establishment loser will be the one who will take Trump's party down to an almost inevitable defeat in November. Is there hope for Ed Gillespie? Only if Corey Stewart can somehow figure out a way to save him by turning out the GOP base in rural Virginia.",1
"Title: The Vile, Anti-Semitic, Brownshirt-y War of Trump Supporters Against Journalists  Article: Trumps had issued repeated threats against freedom of the press, and has even inciting violence against journalists, like Katy Tur, who had to be protected by the Secret Service. Taking their cue from him, his supporters regularly issue death threats against reporters who say something critical about their hero. Katy Tur, who had to be taken under the protection of Trumps own Secret Service detail after he whipped up the crowd against her, threatening her safety, has told her story to Marie Claire: The wave of insults, harassment, and threats, via various social-media feeds, hasnt stopped since.

"Title: Visualizing The Illegal Drone Bombardment: Tweeting Every Known US Strike Takes Student Over 12 Hours  Article: White House Wont Acknowledge Program Even Exists Steve Watson Prisonplanet.com Dec 12, 2012 A student compiled information and links to news reports and documents on every known US drone strike within the last ten years and decided to tweet about every one. Initially he believed the task would take ten minutes to complete. However, over 12 HOURS later he was still tweeting. Im going to tweet the entire history of US drone strikes tomorrow. 10 years in 10 minutes, starting at 12pm. Follow @dronestream for more. Josh Begley (@joshbegley) December 11, 2012 As part of his graduate project, NYU student Josh Begley opened the Twitter account @dronestream, and began tweeting his research Tuesday. At first, I wanted to visualize frequency  to see if I could tweet 10 years in 10 minutes, Begley told the London Guardian. Clearly that didnt work out. After tweeting for 12 hours Ive only reached 2010, and as many folks will tell you, the strikes only pick up from there. The first officially recorded CIA drone strikes took place in 2002 under the Bush administration, since then they have escalated dramatically, particularly since Barak Obama entered the White House in 2008. In his first four years in office, Obama authorized six times more drone strikes in Pakistan than under all eight years of the Bush Administration.

"Title: Millions of America's Gun Nuts Aren't Hiding Their Yearning for Civil War %%  Article: This country is in trouble; not the sequester or the debt ceiling or closing down the country. The Fed and Congress can reverse those issues in a finger snap. Our trouble is coming from the barrel of a gun from rabid paranoids and the people on the take. Include also, terrified legislators staring down that barrel from clever manipulators like Karl Rove, in the employ of filthy rich maggots with no conscience. The farce that is the congressional reaction to the Sandy Hook Bushmaster Childrens Slaughter (BCS) continues unabated. A Senate Judiciary Panel was holding a February 27 hearing on a bill laughingly described as an assault weapons ban (with a mere 2,200 exceptions). Before them was a tearful construction worker Neil Heslin. Hes the father of 1 of the 20 BCS child victims, cherubic, six-year-old Jesse Lewis Heslin. He held up a framed photo portrait of Jesse sitting on his dads lap, the picture the very quintessence of a loving parent-child relationship. Neither the grieving parent or the portrait seemed to emotionally change a single expression or mind of the right-wing gun worshiping members of the panel. Most of whom were wondering which fancy restaurant the gun lobbyists would spring for after the ordeal of hearing yet another sob story was over. Heslin had also appeared as one of numerous invitees to a series of General Assembly Task Force hearings held in several rooms of the Legislative Office Building about five weeks prior to the Senate Judiciary Panel. An estimated 1,500 NRA gun nuts were out in force. Some of them split off into the room where Heslin was testifying.",1
"Title: Philippines: Cruise ship vanishes after reporting sea monster attack  Article: A cruise ship carrying 379 passengers and crew members is reported missing near the southern Philippine island of Mindanao after presumably being attacked by an unidentified sea creature. The Star of Manilla, an ocean liner belonging to Pacific Sunshine Cruises and carrying 255 passengers and 124 crew members, sent a distress signal and several radio messages around 2:30 AM this morning before suddenly disappearing. According to the Philippine Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Wilfredo Tamayo, the ship reported being attacked by a large snake-like creature. The crew reported being attacked by a creature twice as long as their ship. They begged for help, saying a gigantic snake was trying to sink the ship. Admiral Tamayo said that two BO-105C helicopters and a San Juan-class patrol vessel were immediately dispatched to the ships last known location, but found no sign of the ocean liner. The first helicopter arrived on the site less than an hour after the last radio message, but the ship had completely disappeared. Its almost impossible for a ship this size to sink this fast, something must have dragged it under.",0
"Title: Anti-Gay Activist Claims Beauty and the Beast Promotes Inter-Species Breeding %%  Article: Sweet six-and-a-half pound baby Jesus! Who knew that Disneys beloved Beauty and the Beast promotes inter-species breeding? Anti-gay activist Kevin Swanson, who previously warned us that How to Train Your Dragons Gobber the Belch is Destroying Civilization, really hates gays. And he really hates the idea of a human having sex with another species, even when that whole idea is only in his own mind. Because there is no shape-shifting. And no curses that cause shape-shifting. It just doesnt happen. I dont want to suggest this is a very purient case of projection, but folks, this is a very purient case of projection. PFAWs Kyle Mantyla tells us that Swanson said Beauty and the Beast was an insidious effort to homosexualize the next generation of eight and ten-year-old kids and ensure that they are indoctrinated into the homosexual lifestyle. This is how revolutions take place. You are in the middle of a cultural revolution in the United States of America. No, this is not the cultural revolution that Mao Tse-tung brought to China; this is a different kind of cultural revolution, but Im going to say its just about as dangerous  though a bit more insidious. Its the Frozen scandal all over again. The water has gotten a bit too deep for Swanson, just as it was for Michele Bachmann when she attacked Disney for turning our kids gay. But his oxygen-starved mind wasnt done: Even worse, Mantyla writes, Swanson said, the film is promoting inter-species breeding, which he said Hollywood has been pushing since the days of Star Trek. Film history, Swanson! Why did it take so long to notice Disneys unwholesome proclivities?",0
"Title: Republicans Fearmonger Over ISIS to Distract From Their Ineptitude  Article: Fear is a natural emotion that is induced by a perceived threat, or a specific stimulus happening in the present, or some future situation. In both human beings and animals, fear is modulated by cognition and learning and in humans it can be either rational and appropriate, or irrational and inappropriate; irrational fear is a phobia. Republicans have learned that sowing fear is a valuable campaign tactic, and the more irrational fear among their supporters, the more motivated they are to vote for Republicans promising to eliminate whatever perceived threat their bases phobia is grounded in. As political psychologist Drew Westen of Emory University wrote in The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation; In politics, the emotions that really sway voters are hate, hope and fear or anxiety. But the skillful use of fear is unmatched in leading to enthusiasm for one candidate and causing voters to turn away from another. If nothing else, Republicans are skillful at using fear to sway voters and lacking any record to run on, they are opting for fear in the leadup to the midterm elections. After the past few days of Republican fear-mongering over the perceived threat from the ISIS (ISIL) in Iraq and Syria, it is blatantly obvious that besides drumming-up support for a new Middle East war to profit their military industrial complex donors, they are in campaign mode.",1

"Title: Galactic Federation Delivers Ultimatum To United Nations, Threatens To Incinerate Earth If Reasonable Demands Are Not Met Within Ten Years Time!  Article: By Ray Charlston According to anonymous sources within the United Nations, last Thursday an extra-terrestrial claiming to represent the Galactic Federation, a federation of independent planets and alien races, gave a speech before the UN. This meeting was classified as top-secret by the world body, and member nations have voted not to disclose its contents. The ambassador of the Galactic Federation, whose name is unpronounceable by humans, has indicated that they have plans to incinerate Earth, if all of their reasonable demands are not met within the next ten Earth years. The Galactic Federation has demanded that Earth end all economic disparities among racial, ethnic and national groups. Quoting Karl Marx, the ambassador stated that Earths new motto must be From each according to his abilities, to each according to his need. Warning that they will not permit humans to contaminate the galaxy with racism, income inequality, or to possibly enslave and exploit the inhabitants of other planets, the Galactic Federation has also demanded that all Earth governments agree to complete nuclear disarmament. Providing instructions for how to achieve complete economic equality, the ambassador observed that Governments must engage in income redistribution. Governments must tax citizens and then redistribute funds to them in order to achieve complete equality. Explaining that humans differ in abilities, intelligence, and work ethics, it (his race reportedly has no gender) went on to note that it will take a strong and authoritarian world government in order to achieve complete equality, which is humanitys most noble aspiration.",0

"Title: Appalling: Top Catholic bishops employee re-tweets pro-abortion criticism of Trump  Article: NewsAbortion, Catholic Church ONTARIO, January 30, 2017 (LifeSiteNews) -- The Ontario bishops' top employee has been using his personal Twitter account to criticize Donald Trump's pro-life policies. Roger Lawler, General Secretary of the Assembly of Catholic Bishops of Ontario (ACBO), re-tweeted two posts on January 23 critical of President Donald Trumps reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy. The policy banned government funding of foreign pro-abortion groups like the International Planned Parenthood Federation. The two posts criticize Trump for cut[ting] off family planning for millions of poor women globally and for reinstat[ing] Reagan-era abortion restrictions. Lawler also actively promoted the Women's March on Twitter. LifeSiteNews sent evidence of his support for the Women's March to London Bishop Ronald Fabbro, the ACBO's president, who dismissed the concern. When LifeSiteNews followed up with evidence of Lawler's two explicitly pro-abortion re-tweets, Fabbro then failed to respond. Lawler has since set his account to private.

"Title: Illinois Death Watch Continues...  Article: Authored by John Rubino via DollarCollapse.com, Its been a long time coming, but Illinois slow-mo financial disaster is now front page news. A few recent examples: IDOT has told contractors that all construction work is to shut down on June 30, according to a statement. Contractors will be advised to secure work zones to ensure their safety during any potential shutdown. Illinois has gone almost two full years without a state budget, which has hit education funding throughout the state and generated more than $14 billion in unpaid bills.14 Summer is both a high-volume construction season and a vaguely ominous time to cease road repairs; just last week, IDOT released a statement warning that the heat could lead to pavement buckling or blowing out. Without a budget in place, the state is not authorized to make payments to the association or Mega Millions. Lottery proceeds are about 2% of state revenue. Speaking of revenue corporate income tax collection is down 41.3%. Sales taxes are flat. How is this supposed to work? A financial crunch is spiraling into a serious problem for Illinois lawmakers, prompting some observers to wonder if the state might make history by becoming the first to go bankrupt. At the moment, its impossible for a state to file for bankruptcy protection, which is only afforded to counties and municipalities like Detroit. Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection could be extended to states if Congress took up the issue, although Stanford Law School professor Michael McConnell noted in an article last year that he believed the precedents are iffy for extending the option to states.",0

"Title: Man claims that drinking gallons of sperm cured him of homosexuality  Article: TUSCALOOSA, Alabama | A well-known naturopath and former LGBT militant claims to have cured himself of his homosexuality by drinking two glasses of sperm per day for a few months. 61-year old Brian Franklin was for several decades militant and leader of several organizations working for the promotion of LGBT rights. He says despite his activism, hes always felt uneasy about being gay and always hoped he could be cured. The professional naturopath said he spent years studying the nature of homosexuality and the chemical properties of thousands of substances. After several unsuccessful attempts with various herbs, he turned his attention to a substance which turned out to have an almost perfect chemical and hormonal properties: human semen. He created a solution composed of 95% pure human semen, in which a mix of vitamin and hormones is added. Some preliminary tests with rats produced some very promising results, so Mr. Franklin decided to test it himself. Over the last year, he ingested two glasses (600 ml) of this treatment every day and he says the results are conclusive. Only a month after I started the treatment, I began feeling less attracted to men. After six months, I was almost totally straight and I found women hot for the first time in my life! Mr. Franklin is convinced that this new scientific breakthrough could help millions of homosexuals around the world. I just drink one glass of semen in the morning and one in the evening, and I can live like a normal person.",1
"Title: Germany: Terror Cases Quadruple to 900  Article: There is an argument to be made that Obama's Arab Spring, with all its resulting consequences, including the various wars and civil wars, broke Europe. Whether that accelerated path to a civilizational conflict actually serves as a wake up call or a closing bell is still up in the air. But Europe, as I have discussed previously, is quickly stumbling into a war that it isn't prepared for. It's bad in France. It's bad in the UK. And Germany has hit its own speed bump with Frau Merkel at the wheel. The number of terrorism-related cases investigated by German authorities have quadrupled over the past year, newspaper Welt am Sonntag revealed Sunday. Prosecutors have opened more than 900 cases so far this year, compared to 240 throughout 2016. Just 80 cases related to terrorism reached the courts in 2013. The federal prosecutors office cant keep up with the increase and nearly 300 cases have been transferred to the state level. Not all cases involve plans to carry out attacks. Migrants from Syran, Iraq and Afghanistan have been tried over alleged membership in terror groups without being suspected of planning attacks on European soil. Germanys federal police (BKA) estimates 705 Islamist extremists are willing to carry out terror attacks, up from 600 during an estimate in February. That's far too many for German law enforcement to cope with. Terror cases have outpaced the resources of a number of European countries. And they're pushing our limits in America. Comey stated that there were around 2,000 terrorism investigations. 1,000 of those came from home grown violent extremism with no evidence of contact with foreign terrorists.",1
"Title: USDA Ruling Imperils 257  Article: USDA Ruling Imperils Food Supply By Christopher J. Petherick Despite widespread opposition to genetically modified (GM) crops, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently approved GMalfalfa, threatening organic farms across the United States. In a related development, official Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documents that were recently leaked show that the federal bureaucracy ignored concerns from its own scientists that a new, advanced pesticide will likely kill honeybees. Bees are already struggling to survive in this country due to mysterious and bizarre condition: colony collapse disorder (CCD). On Jan. 27, the [USDA] announced it would allow the unrestricted, nationwide planting of genetically engineered alfalfa, reported the Rodale Institute, the nations leading organic advocacy organizations. The concern among organic growers is that, in the years ahead, GM alfalfa will contaminate natural and organic alfalfa, because, unlike most crops, alfalfa pollen can travel for miles, mixing in with other alfalfa varieties in the area. In a landmark 2006 study, Colorado State University researchers found GM alfalfa contaminated almost all of the alfalfa for miles around one test field that had been planted with the lab-created plants. They concluded: The [GM alfalfa] gene was found at 83 percent of the collection sites, out to a distance of 1.7 miles from the pollen source. Why the concern over GMalfalfa? Well, alfalfa is the most common feed source for livestock such as cattle, sheep and goats.",0
"Title: New York City jihad bomber gets multiple life sentences for blast that injured 30  Article: Even today, he appears to remain steadfast in that commitment and has shown no remorse. The defendants communications while incarcerated further demonstrate that, far from appreciating the depravity of his actions, he is proud of what he did, scornful of the American justice system, and as dedicated as ever to his terrorist ideology. And while he is in prison, even if it is for the rest of his life, what will be done to disabuse him of that terrorist ideology? Nothing. In fact, U.S. prison officials will do everything they can to reinforce it. The U.S. prison system, like the military and more, is committed to the proposition that Islam is a religion of peace, and that its practice is to be encouraged. Confronted with someone like Rahimi who tried to murder people in the name of Islam and in accord with its teachings, they give him a prison life that is filled only with reinforcement of the ideology that landed him in prison in the first place: prayers with other inmates, the Quran supplied and treated with the utmost respect, etc. ""Chelsea bomber gets multiple life prison sentences for New York blast that injured 30, by Travis Fedschun, Fox News, February 13, 2018:  The convicted terrorist who planted two pressure-cooker bombs on New York City streets  including one that injured 30 people with a rain of shrapnel when it detonated  was sentenced Tuesday to multiple life terms in prison.

Authorities found all the children living in deplorable living conditions after raiding the property looking specifically for a three-year-old boy. According to The Daily Caller, the police didnt find the little boy, named Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, but they did discover 11 other children between the ages of one and 15-years-old being held in the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said in a statement posted to the agencys Facebook page Saturday. Hogrefe also added that he only saw a few potatoes and a box of rice as food at the compound. Abdul-Ghanis mother reported her son missing after Wahhaj took the boy, who turned 4 on Monday, to the park in Clayton County, Georgia, and didnt return, The Albuquerque Journal reported. She added the boy suffers from a medical condition. Investigators believe that the three-year-old boy, who turned four on Monday, they were looking for had been at the compound in earlier weeks. Siraj Wahhaj, 39, and Lucas Morten, two very heavily armed men who are believed to be extremist[s] of the Muslim belief, were running the horrifying compound, Hogrefe said. When police arrived on the scene, Wahhaj was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and several loaded 30-round magazines. He also allegedly had on him four loaded pistols. According to a report by Fox News, Hogrefe said authorities had conducted surveillance of the compound while looking for the missing boy before he decided Thursday to get a search warrant.",1
"Title: Now In Effect: Sweeping Vermont Privacy Law Will Hinder Several Federal Surveillance Programs  Article: By Mike Maharrey A sweeping new law that establishes robust privacy protections in Vermont went into effect today. It not only limits warrantless surveillance and helps ensure electronic privacy in the Green Mountain State, it will also hinder several federal surveillance programs that rely on cooperation and data from state and local law enforcement. The new law bans warrantless use of stingray devices to track the location of phones and sweep up electronic communications, restricts the use of drones for surveillance by police, and generally prohibits law enforcement officers from obtaining electronic data from service providers without a warrant or a judicially issued subpoena. Sen. Tim Ashe, Sen. Joe Benning and Sen. Dick Sears prefiled Senate Bill 155 (S.155) in December. As filed, the legislation addressed the use of drones by Vermont law enforcement, and placed some additional limits on storage and sharing of data collected by ALPRs. An amendment in a Senate committee added provisions to limit warrantless collection of electronic data. Amendments in the House banned the warrantless use of stingray devices and ultimately put off significant changes to current ALPR law. Gov. Shumlin signed S.155 into law on June 6. It went into effect in stages. Extension of the current ALPR statue went into effect immediately, along with study requirements. Minor changes to current ALPR law took effect July 1. Sections relating to drones, stingrays and warrantless data collection become effective today. STINGRAYS The new law virtually bans the use of cell site simulators, known as stingrays.",1

As usual, progressives lined up to blame the NRA. And, as usual, they were all so very, very, wrong. Murders committed   Planned Parenthood: Approximately 60 million since 1973. The NRA: 0. Ever. Liberals did get to learn a whole new thing to not understand. Bump stocks? What NRA-owned, rethuglikkkan, scumbag signed off on letting those be legal? Did you know an assault rifle can fire between 400 and 800 rounds a minute? Noted firearms experts Senator Dianne Feinstein and celebutante Kim Kardashian both reminded fans of that this week. And they would know; one of them even made a sex tape! At least, I hope only one of them did. Among the misinformation spread by feverish Democrats this week: Any civilian can buy a machine gun, no questions asked, over the internet; they sell automatic rounds at gun shows, and something called gun silencers exists. Im surprised they didnt claim Stephen Paddock got hold of a phased plasma rifle in the 40 watt range. Phased plasma rifles dont kill people. Cyberdyne Model 101 T-800s kill people. Gun-grabbers also cant figure out what happens if firearms are restricted to government use only. Broke: All cops are brutal, racist, pigs! Woke: Only cops should have guns!",1
"Title: Terror threat raised as Cotswolds Vicar declares Church of England CaliphateNewsBiscuit  Article: With much of the world distracted by the campaign against ISIS in the Middle East, Britain faces a new home-grown terror threat, after Stow-In- the-Wold vicar Jeremy Blythe pronounced an independent Anglican Caliphate stretching across much of rural Oxfordshire. We have seized control of the parish councils of Stow, Coln St Aldwyns and Daglingworth, announced Blythe this morning, and as I speak, our forces are advancing on Shipston on Stour. Asked why he had taken this action, Blythe explained We are sick of your Western materialistic values, with your Minidisc players and Sodastreams. We intend to go back to a purer time, when vicars wobbled about on bicycles, all vergers looked like Derek Nimmo and Cliff Richard was never anything other than non-threatening. While information from inside the Caliphate remains scarce, an Amnesty International report has already detailed a catalogue of human rights abuses, describing the number of forced jumble sales as shockingly high. The subjugation of women was also a big concern, with reports that some old ladies were being forced to bake up to twenty trays of flapjacks every day. Despite this, support for the Caliphate appears to be on the rise, with large numbers of foreign fighters flocking to the region. Wendy Briggs of Runcorn, described how her own son, Gary, had been radicalised. He was just a normal teenager really, you know, sullen and argumentative with stupid hair, but gradually he started to change. I should have seen the signs really.

"Title: Trump Is Seeding War Clouds Over Iran  Article: https://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/trump-is-seeding-war-clouds-over-iran/  Trump and Pompeo are squeezing Iran where it hurts. They are trying to prevent Iran from selling oil internationally. They are applying maximum pressure upon Iran. This is overt. It is announced policy. For example, the State Department says  Very broadly, Saudi Arabia is a key partner in our effort to isolate and pressure Iran. And as I said, we had a number of bureaus from the State Department to discuss energy, diplomacy, security, and economic pressure. We were also joined by Treasury Under Secretary Sigal Mandelker for some of these meetings so that they can hear from Treasury officials and coordinate our efforts on applying maximum economic pressure on Iran. The U.S. is threatening China and India if they buy Iranian oil:  On Tuesday a senior State Department official described tightening the noose on Tehran as one of our top national security priorities. The official warned countries including China and India, who are key buyers of Iranian oil, that they should stop purchasing crude from the country before the November deadline or face US sanctions. Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally and enemy of Iran, will pump more oil to mitigate price effects of cutting Iran out of the international market. This increases enmity between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The economic isolation of Iran via an economic blockade deprives Iran of essential revenues. In essence, the U.S. policy is an act of war. Trump is seeding war clouds over Iran. He wants Iranians to overturn their government.",1

"Title: Northern Ireland legislature rejects gay marriageagain  Article: NewsHomosexuality, Politics - U.S. BELFAST, April 30, 2013 (LifeSiteNews.com)  For the second time in a year, the Legislative Assembly of Northern Ireland has rejected attempts to install gay marriage in the province, in a vote of 53 to 42. A similar motion was defeated by 50 votes to 45 last October. Mike Judge, communications director for the Christian Institute said the motion was introduced by Sinn Fein following a decision by the Republic of Ireland to have a referendum on redefining marriage. But the proposal in the Assembly did not give the people of Northern Ireland any say in the matter  and that spoke volumes. But Judge said that the active opposition of Christians both in Northern Ireland and in Britain had a decisive impact. It just shows that the plans to redefine marriage can be defeated when people are prepared to take action, he said. The vote against same-sex marriage will likely cause tension between Northern Irish MPs at Westminster and the efforts by the David Cameron government to force gay marriage into the rest of the country. Following the vote in the House of Commons in February passing the UKs same-sex marriage legislation, it was revealed that of the 13 Northern Ireland MPs, only two voted in favour of changing the definition of marriage and nine against, with two abstaining. The Stormont vote follows a demand by Amnesty International that the province be forced to accept gay marriage though activism in the courts, should the democratic route fail.",0
"Title: ""The Homosexuals"" a grim documentary video on homosexuality filmed in the late 1960s  Article: In both of the documentaries, psychiatrists say that homosexuality is a psychiatric disorder and this is extensively drummed home in one segment of ""The Homosexuals. "" Some of the points that are made are: One psychiatrist says that there can't be any happy homosexuals because their psychological maladjustment prevents them from being happy. Their maladaptive behaviors will always get them into trouble. Homosexuals aren't born. Homosexuality develops in childhood, often during the first three years of life. The theories of how men become homosexual are discussed as if they are proven truths. Mother is overly protective, prefers the homosexual son. Father is emotionally distant, competes with son, may ignore him or be aggressive toward him. (There's no mention that DNA might be involved or that homosexuality might be a mixture of nature and nurture. ) The psychiatrists really don't cite any evidence for their pronouncements, they just pontificate. One says that up to 30% or homosexuals can change their behavior with treatment. Another mentions ""latent homosexuality,"" which was thrown about wildly in the 1950s. In a law enforcement segment: A 19-year old service member is entrapped for performing a ""lewd act"" in a men's room. Listen as he virtually begs the police to not tell his superiors. One of the police says that the homosexual problem is growing and he's worried about how this will affect society as a whole. A survey of the U.S. population shows that citizens are strongly opposed to even allowing homosexual acts between consenting adults in private. Two Christian religious speak out. They are somewhat conciliatory.",1
"Title: 'War Crime': Ex-US Army Officer Slams Pentagon's Alleged Arms Supplies to Syria  Article: The reported US supplies of Soviet-era munitions to Syrian rebels not only ""openly violates"" legal norms against financing terrorism, but also risks igniting a greater conflict across the Middle East, Scott Bennett, former US Army psychological operations officer and State Department counterterrorism contractor, told Sputnik. Untraceable Weapons Earlier, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) revealed in a report that Washington is allegedly running a $2.2 billion Soviet-era weapons pipeline for Syrian rebels. The Pentagon is reportedly working with contractors and subcontractors in Eastern Europe and the post-Soviet bloc. The munitions are being delivered to US allied forces in northern and southern Syria. The Pentagon is providing Syrian rebels with Soviet-era weapons because ""they are essentially untraceable, have an endless shelf life, and are also a financial currency that can be used to continue all conflicts,"" Bennett pointed out. Moreover, according to him, this fact is no surprise since it has been a ""standard tactic of US diplomatic war strategy for decades and used against numerous countries over the past 70 years"" in different parts of the world. Despite the fact that the Pentagon has denied the claims, Bennett argued that the report ""should be used as an exhibit in a UN International Criminal Court indictment against the US for both war crimes and crimes against humanity.",0
"Title: Man transported to hospital after getting squirrel stuck in his rectum  Article: A man from Moultonborough in New Hampshire had to be transported to the hospital this afternoon after his pet squirrel got stuck in his anal cavity. 60-year Ray Frankfurt called 911 himself around 3 pm after he found himself in a pretty uncomfortable position. Janice Monroe, the operator who took the call, says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation. He told me that hed fallen on his pet squirrel named Slimy and that the animal was now stuck in his anus. I was convinced that it was a teenager making a prank call. Despite Ms. Monroes doubts, she sent an ambulance to the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious. Frank Meyers, one of the paramedics who transported Mr. Frankfurt, claims the poor man was lying naked in his bathroom and a hairy red tail was protruding from his anus. He kept screaming out in pain as the animal was biting and scratching him. The guy looked like he was going through hell!

The retired mailman suffered from severe internal bleeding but was finally stabilized after a two-hour surgery. The squirrel, unfortunately, didnt survive his misadventure. Mr.",0
"Title: Even fake news is vital to our liberty  Article: Part 2 of 2. Read the first part, 1st Amendment written to protect fake news  Although the term fake news was not part of their lexicon, the Founding Fathers understood quite well the concept. As I discussed last week in 1st Amendment was written to protect fake news, highly partisan editors used the power of their presses to disseminate their views with little concern over whether they were being truthful or even upheld basic standards of decorum. Newspapers, pamphlets and broadsheets provided nourishment to both spark the American Revolution and keep it alive. Doubtless King George thought the ongoing lists of grievances colonial editors proclaimed against the crown were at best overblown if not outright lies. As Ken Burns notes in his book , Infamous Scribblers: The Founding Fathers and The Rowdy Beginnings of American Journalism:  Certainly the war would not have begun as soon as it did without the encouragement of the press. As New York Journal editor John Holt said on one occasion to Sam Adams, It was by means of News papers that we receivd & spread the Notice of the tyrannical Designs formed against America, and kindled a Spirit that has been sufficient to repel them. And almost certainly, the war would not have ended with an American victory in a period of seven years from the first shot to signed treaty had not the newspapers  and some pamphlets  constantly reminded the colonists of the cause they shared, thereby inspiring the valor of soldiers and the patience and support of civilians. The British knew it, too.",1
"Title: Krugman Uses the D-Word as Millionaire Pols Gear up to Screw Already-Suffering People  Article: I've witnessed several outbreaks of corporate-sponsored Beltway horribleness, when politicians, seizing a chance to realize their political and ideological fantasies, surpass their normal everyday plutocratic pursuits and baldly, in broad daylight, really stick it to non-rich people. Among the worst: NAFTA, the invasion of Iraq, and the bank bailouts. But I don't know that I've seen anything more appalling than this latest offensive in the class war disguised as a debate about debt. There is no crisis. There is no crisis. Do you feel me yet? There is no crisis. Everyone knows the ceiling with be raised. The Republicans have acknowledged as much. Wall Street and the Chamber of Horrors will not allow their GOP puppets to default. But (millionaire) pols of both parties are exploiting this phony crisis to cut government spending. Why? Because they want to cut government spending. Because Wall Street wants them to cut government spending. Because conservative Republicans and their kinder gentler cousins in the Democratic Party known as neoliberals have wanted to cut government spending, including Social Security, for years. Because it's Grover Norquist's world and we're just dying in it. The austerity (but not for wars or Wall Street)-mania would be harmful and right-wing even if the economy were humming along.

"Title: Francis: A Pope for our times  Part 3  Article: NewsCatholic Church EDITOR'S NOTE: The following is the third of seven excerpts from a talk by Fr. Linus Clovis at the Catholic Truth Scotland Conference in June 2016. Part 1 is here and Part 2 is here. To read his presentation in its entirety, click here. November 2, 2016 (LifeSiteNews)  In Genesis, we read that the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to till it and keep it. That is, God assigned Adam two tasks: first he was to cultivate the Garden and secondly, he was to guard it. His failure in the second task gave the serpent his opportunity. Christ entrusted to Simon Peter the visible leadership of the Church with the double task of feeding and tending the flock. That is, as a good shepherd, he was to guard, protect and preach the Faith to the flock and so keep them from error and deception.\ Our Lord, at the Last Supper, warned Peter that the serpent was already watching and merely waiting for an opportunity to attack. Specifically, with words expressing both what Satan desired and what God permitted, Christ said: Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren. God permitted this trial for at least two reasons. First, that the Apostles might understand how weak they were of themselves and second that after their fall, they would rise again by His grace and would be cleansed and purified as sifted wheat.",0

Echoing Donald Trumps earlier statement that the Orlando shooter, although born in New York and raised in Florida, was born an Afghan, the 64-year-old former GOPs vice presidential nominee reportedly referenced recent attacks and the ongoing Afghan war as her top two reasons America needs to ban afghans: There are dangerous patterns deeply woven into the very fabric of many afghans.

"Title: Get ready for gas tax hikes  Article: Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. With the economy improving and an ambitious infrastructure plan on the White House agenda, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is beginning to make its case for a hefty increase in fuel taxes. According to Chamber President Tom Donohue, the group is looking to hike the gas tax by 25 cents a gallon over the next five years. Though the organization plans to ask the Trump administration and Congress for a gradual increase to ease pushback, it would also support a one-time hike in the full amount. Five cents [per year] over five years, but if we can get it all in the beginning, wed take it. Its simpler; you do it once, Donohue told reporters. You begin to accrue and build up a sock of money which youre going to need for these projects. Because the gas tax hasnt been increased since 1993, the proposal likely faces an uphill battle. But Donohue says the Chamber has new allies in the fight. Ive been pushing this for a long, long time, but now gangs of people are pushing it, he said in an interview. And because President Trump is eager to fund an ambitious infrastructure plan, the White House could play a key role in securing the increase. As reported by The Washington Post:  In private meetings, Trump has floated the idea of raising the federal gas tax by as much as 50 cents per gallon but received a chilly reception to that idea, particularly from Republican lawmakers. Still, aides say, the idea of an increase hasnt been taken off the table. As envisioned by the chamber, the 25-cent increase would be applied to the current taxes of 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon for diesel fuel.",0
"Title: San Francisco gives pot prohibitionists the finger  Article: Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. San Francisco officials are retroactively applying the citys marijuana legalization laws, a move that will help thousands of residents convicted of pot-related crimes over the decades expunge or reduce the convictions. The San Francisco Chronicle reported:  The move will affect thousands of people whose marijuana convictions brand them with criminal histories that can hurt chances for finding jobs and obtaining some government benefits. Proposition 64, which state voters passed in November 2016, legalized the recreational use of marijuana in California for those 21 and older and permitted the possession up to one ounce of cannabis. The legislation also allows those with past marijuana convictions that would have been lesser crimes  or no crime at all  under Prop. 64 to petition a court to recall or dismiss their cases. Rather than leaving it up to individuals to petition the courts  which is time consuming and can cost hundreds of dollars in attorney fees  Gascn said San Francisco prosecutors will review and wipe out convictions en masse. The district attorney said his office will dismiss and seal more than 3,000 misdemeanor marijuana convictions in San Francisco dating back to 1975, and review and re-sentence thousands of felony marijuana cases. The move comes as the Jeff Sessions Department of Justice continues to work to remind state and local governments that federal law still prohibits the sale and use of the plant throughout the United States.

"Title: ""Clinton Foundation Is Charity Fraud Of Epic Proportions"", Analyst Charges In Stunning Takedown  Article: In early May, we introduced readers to Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who uncovered financial discrepancies at General Electric before its stock crashed in 2008, and whom the Sunday Times of London described as ""one of the finest analysts of financial statements on the planet"" in a 2009 story detailing the troubles at AIG. Having moved on beyond simple corporate fraud, Ortel spent the past year and a half digging into something more relevant to the current US situation:""charities"", and specifically the Clinton Foundations public records, federal and state-level tax filings, and donor disclosures. Four months ago, Ortel began releasing his preliminary findings in the first of a series of up to 40 planned reports on his website. His allegation was simple: this is a charity fraud. To learn more about the Clinton Foundation, Ortel decided to ""take it apart and see how it worked"" and he has been doing that ever since February 2015. I decided, as I did with GE, lets pick one thats complicated, said Ortel. The Clinton Foundation is complicated, but its really very small compared to GE. When Ortel tried to match up the Clinton Foundations tax filings with the disclosure reports from its major donors, he said he started to find problems. That includes records from the foundations many offshootsincluding the Clinton Health Access Initiative and the Clinton Global Initiativeas well as its foreign subsidiaries.

"Title: Pope Francis Invites The Homeless, Undocumented Immigrants And Prostitutes To Exclusive Catered Vatican Banquet  Article: By Werombi Towradji Pope Francis is no stranger to controversy, having been a frequent target for criticism by the radical and extreme right. His Holiness, the Bishop of Rome and Vicar of Christ, recently held a banquet at the Vatican. It was unlike any in the entire history of the Roman Catholic Church. Unlike other elite Vatican events, this one had a very unusual guest list, including prostitutes, drug addicts, unwed mothers, undocumented migrants and the homeless. Pope Francis defended the banquet, citing Matthew 9:11-13 from the Bible. The verses read: And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples: Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners? But Jesus hearing it, said: They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill. Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I am not come to call the just, but sinners. It is time for the church to enter the real world. We must recognize that real people are complex. No one is perfect, least of all me Pope Francis observed. Referring to himself as the Chief of sinners, Pope Francis said We have all sinned. It is not my job to judge anyone, it is only to share Gods boundless and infinite love. You cannot claim to truly love another if you also judge them at the same time. Do not forget Matthew 7:1-3. As pope, I have a special responsibility to seek after those souls that are most in need of my help. Shall I with one hand draw the person near and with the other push them away?

Anyway, this small band of citizens  who happen to still believe this is a nation of laws  showed up with signs and Rove masks and stood on the corner, supported by honking citizens driving by on their way to and from lunch breaks, etc. (I think we would have had a bigger group, except that it was on a Friday morning, lasting until one oclock.)",0
"Title: Blowback: CNN Pushes Effort to Ban the Term Fake News'  Article: This article was originally published by Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars.com  CNN is now pushing an effort to ban the term fake news after the slogan became synonymous with CNN itself thanks to President Donald Trump. In a CNN opinion piece written by Hossein Derakhshan and Claire Wardle, who are affiliated with the globalist Council of Europe, the authors argue that the term fake news has become meaningless and lost its power because politicians (primarily Donald Trump) have hijacked it as a way to undermine the media establishment. The authors decry the fact that many people now believe the mainstream media peddles fabricated stories and that information monopolies are being challenged by the ability for anyone in the world to have a platform. Remember when the mainstream media & the Hillary campaign invented the term ""fake news"" in an effort to discredit alternative & right of center media outlets?

Now, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Stanford University are discovering that oil pollution can elicit early heart attacks in this species of fish.These fish, which can weigh up to 550 pounds and measure 6.5 feet long, are not immune from the damaging effects of oil pollution. As one of the world's largest fish species in the world, the bluefin tuna is also built for both speed and endurance. With the ability to retract their dorsal and pectoral fins, bluefin tuna can reduce drag and swim up to 43 miles per hour. Their gorgeously colored metallic blue top and silver-white bottom help keep the fish camouflaged in the open seas, from top to bottom. But what the fish can not hide from or swim faster than is a massive oil spill. In this new study, oil pollution is found to block the bluefin tuna's cardiac tissues from receiving needed calcium and potassium, causing early heart attacks.The early die-off of these bluefin tuna in the Gulf of Mexico could mean shortages of food for those who depend on the species for survival. The oil pollution could possibly be passed upward through the food chain.",0

Most VT readers know the foreign power that Senator McCain really works for along with almost every other Member of the US Congress because of their Oath to AIPAC. And we know that the real purpose of ISIS has been to destabilize the Mideast, Balkanize Syria and Iran and now Europe with massive immigration. But it was created also to protect the business interests in Israel related to new massive Golan Heights oil finds and a new planned pipeline to supply oil and gas to Europe. We know that another reason for the hiring and deployment of the mercenaries in order to create ISIS was to assist NATO in isolating and weakening the Russian Republic in order to protect Big Oils interests.",1

One of the regulations up for the chopping block was the Waters of the United States rule, an Obama era move that formally extended the governments authority to curtail pollution to small waterways. The original move proved controversial among industry interests because of the cost of complying with the regulations. In the aftermath of the rules implementation, interests in the matter brought dozens of lawsuits against the government, and in one of them, the Supreme Court has just unanimously ruled against the government  in other words, against the Trump administration. The ruling is not on the merits of the rule itself, but rather on the proper court for hearing challenges to the rule in question. The Trump administration has asserted that courts of appeals are the proper venue for such challenges, while industry interests have insisted that district courts are the proper venue.",0
