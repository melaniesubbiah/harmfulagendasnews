"Title: Unnecessary Loss of Life  Article: War is nasty, brutal and costly. In our latest wars, many of the casualties suffered by American troops are a direct result of their having to obey rules of engagement created by politicians who have never set foot on  or even seen  a battlefield. Today's battlefield commanders must be alert to the media and do-gooders who are all too ready to demonize troops involved in a battle that produces noncombatant deaths, so-called collateral damage. According to a Western Journalism article by Leigh H Bravo, ""Insanity: The Rules of Engagement"" (http://tinyurl.com/p59nlqs), our troops fighting in Afghanistan cannot do night or surprise searches. Also, villagers must be warned prior to searches. Troops may not fire at the enemy unless fired upon. U.S. forces cannot engage the enemy if civilians are present. And only women can search women. Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney said: ""We handcuffed our troops in combat needlessly. This was very harmful to our men and has never been done in U.S combat operations that I know of."" Collateral damage and the unintentional killing of civilians are a consequence of war. But the question we should ask is: Are our troops' lives less important than the inevitable collateral damage? The unnecessary loss of life and casualties that result from politically correct rules of engagement are about to be magnified in future conflicts by mindless efforts to put women in combat units. In 2013, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta officially lifted the ban on women serving in ground combat roles. On Jan. 1, 2016, all branches of the military must either open all positions to women or request exceptions.",0
"Title: US Bishops Organization Gives Glowing Review of Homosexual-Sex Propaganda Film  Article: News By Hilary White WASHINGTON, December 15, 2005 (LifeSiteNews.com) - The Catholic Church identifies homosexuality as a serious moral and psychological disorder of unknown origin, one that is serious enough to make a man who suffers from it ineligible for priestly ordination. Nonetheless, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) has issued a glowing movie review of the homosexual propaganda film, Brokeback Mountain, a story of two rugged cowboys who engage in homosexual liaisons and adultery. The films theme is a favorite of homosexual folklore: two lonesome cowboys, removed from the repressions of artificial social mores by their work in the great rugged outdoors. Freed from the constraints of female society, their passions erupt in what is depicted as some deep, natural, repressed well. The sex is depicted off screen in a way described by the author of the short story upon which the film is based as a manly act, quick, rough, laughing and snorting. The unnamed USCCB reviewer, in keeping with the now-standard tone of acceptance required of Catholic progressives, walked a hair-thin line between Catholic teaching and wholehearted approval of the homosexual lifestyle. The Catholic Church, the reviewer writes, makes a distinction between homosexual orientation and activity, Ennis and Jacks continuing physical relationship is morally problematic. He goes on to praise the film saying, While the actions taken by Ennis and Jack cannot be endorsed, the universal themes of love and loss ring true. A Christian activist who has worked to debunk the propaganda of the homosexual movement was more forthright.",1
"Title: Ex MI6 Spy Who Compiled Golden Showers Report Was FBI Source for FIFA Scandal  Article: The man behind the unsubstantiated Golden Showers report on President-elect Donald Trumps supposed ties to Russia is a former officer in Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), and was the FBIs source in the FIFA corruption scandal. The operative, identified as Christopher Steele by the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, is a former Russian operations officer for Britains MI6 intelligence agency, Reuters reported. After leaving M16, Steele worked with the FBI, providing intelligence on the world soccer associations ties to suspected Russian gangsters. Steele had originally been hired to investigate Trump by political opponents within the Democratic and Republican parties, but it has not been revealed exactly who hired him. He then decided to share the dossier with the FBI, who took it seriously, despite the far-fetched allegations, due to his previous work on the FIFA case. Hes a meticulous professional, and there are no questions about his integrity, a US official who has worked with Steele told Reuters. The information he provided me [about Russia] was valuable and useful. The allegations in the report have been dismissed by both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and even Buzzfeed, who initially published the report, noted discrepancies and acknowledged that nothing in the dossier could be confirmed. Trump has referred to the report as a political witch hunt and phony, fake news. Incoming White House Press Secretary and Communications Director Sean Spicer called Buzzfeeds decision to release the report without confirming any of the allegations shameful and disgraceful, during a news conference on Wednesday.",1
"Title: America's Immigration Voice.  Article: VDARE Radio is up with ""NATIONAL REVIEW Cucking Again On Immigration""--go here to read or listen, here to download the MP3. What struck me about it is the fact that NR has no problem insulting both rural Pennsylvanians and Alabamans by calling Lou Barletta  The Man from Alabama, PA  [National Review, September 18, 2017]  Franklin County is Red America. It's a rural county, about twenty-five miles west of Gettysburg, and it includes the towns of Waynesboro, Chambersburg, and Mercersburg. It was originally settled by the Scotch-Irish, and has plenty of Brethren and Mennonites along with a fast-growing population of evangelicals. The joke that Pennsylvanians tell about their state is that it has Philadelphia on one end, Pittsburgh on the other, and Alabama in the middle. Franklin County is in the Alabama part. It strikes me as I drive there that even though I am going north across the Mason-Dixon line, I feel as if I were going south. The local culture owes more to Nashville, Houston, and Daytona than to Washington, Philadelphia, or New York. One Nation, Slightly Divisible, December 2001  It reminded me of something David Brooks said years ago, when he made a quasi-anthropological study of Red America after the 2000 election.You can see a rebuttal from Missouri farmer Blake Hurst here: The Plains vs. The Atlantic American Enterprise Online ,March 2002. Rural Pennsylvania is not like Alabama for the simple reason that they don't have blacks--in 2000, out of 3.5 million rural Pennsylvanians (as described by the Center For Rural PA ) there were ""157,200 residents, or 5 percent of the total population, who were non-white and/or Hispanic.""",0
"Title: NYC MAYOR DE BLASIO Blasted by Queens WomanHe Runs Away! [Video]  Article: Vickie Paladino and her husband were driving through their neighborhood when they spotted the mayor. Paladino was so upset over de Blasios trip to Germany to speak at a G-20 protest in lieu of attending a vigil for slain New York police officer Miosotis Familia that she left the car to berate him. As de Blasio approached her and a group of others to shake hands, she started to ask about his trip. He turned around with his security detail and went to his car. I want to know why you let your police officers down and our country down by going to Germany and protesting against our country, she yelled at de Blasio. I want to know why youre doing that. OK? I dont care about the trees. Well work it out. CBS reporter Marcia Kramer had a scathing assessment of de Blasio, who she said simply fled when Paladino started her criticism. The woman in the white shirt single-handedly brought WrestleMania to the streets of Whitestone, Queens, but her opponent Bill de Blasio was no Hulk Hogan or The Rock, Kramer said. He was more like the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard Of Oz. Paladino caught the attention of the media assembled for the event, and she told reporters that shed had it with de Blasio and doubted he had a friend in the city. This is got to do with a liberal, socialist mayor who is running our city and has no regard for our country, she said. Why did you go to Germany?",1
"Title: OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro Stands as Democracys Most Courageous Defender in the Region  Article: The Organization of American States (OAS) recently commemorated the 15th anniversary of the organizations democratic charter. In the decade and a half since its founding, the charter and its spirit have been desecrated and mocked. The flourishing of elected dictatorships of the left, since the late 1990s, was met with indifference and moral shallowness as political opponents were imprisoned, judiciaries were bulldozed by despots, journalists were persecuted, and society as a whole was intimidated by the authorities. For almost two decades the OAS has been nothing but a club of presidents all ignoring violations of democracy and human rights in the name of regional integration. Such integration was supposed to create a powerful economic and political Latin American block. Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, and other countries that openly violated human rights were very much part of this project and as regional allies they could not be alienated. Therefore, the idea promoted by countries such as Brazil and other democracies was to say that the principle of sovereignty and respect for each countries internal affairs had priority over the application of the OAS charter. Thus, Inter-American protection of democracy was seen as an outrageous intervention that violated national rights, instead of being seen as a tool to protect universal values of freedom and human dignity. This view was also supported by the former OAS Secretary General, Jose Miguel Insulza. It is obvious that the Inter-American democratic charter by virtue of being a set of international laws, and not national laws, implies that there is an element of interference in internal affairs.",0
"Title: PragerU: Douglas Murray Explains the Suicide of Europe | Blog Posts  Article: The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity Islam, Douglas Murrays important book, continues to influence the debate on allowing mass immigration of Muslims, a historic enemy of the West. The political problem was Europes foolish invitation, led by Germanys Chancellor Merkel, to millions of dissatisfied muslims to come live in the West. But the psychological cause is a disconnect from the history of Europe civilization, which still includes the Enlightenment. Murrays analysis is that Europes elite (but not its average citizens) feel a loss of confidence about the last centurys failures of history require the penance of surrendering to the diverse hordes of the Third World. From the outside, it does seem Euro-elites are throwing in the towel on the continent with its complicated history. Murray has distilled important points from his book into a five-minute explainer for a PragerU video:  Heres a transcript of the video:  DOUGLAS MURRAY: The civilization born of Judeo-Christian values, ancient Greek philosophy and the discoveries of the Enlightenment is staring at the abyss, brought there by its own hand. To put it starkly: Europe is committing suicide. How did this happen? Its a complicated story, but there are two major causes. The first is the mass movement of peoples into Europe. This has been going on steadily since the end of World War II but sped up massively in the migration crisis of 2015, when more than a million migrants poured into Europe from the Middle East, North Africa and East Asia. The second, and equally significant, is that Europe lost faith in itselfits beliefs, its traditions and even its very legitimacy.",1
"Title: Would-be Caliph Erdogan: Jerusalem is our red line demands Trump return from this grave mistake immediately  Article: ANKARA: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is calling a summit of the main pan-Islamic body in Istanbul on Dec 13 to discuss the expected US move to recognise Jerusalem as Israels capital, his spokesman said on Wednesday (Dec 6). In the face of developments that arouse sensitivity over the status of Jerusalem, Mr President is calling a leaders summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in order to display joint action among Islamic countries, presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told reporters in Ankara. He said the summit meeting would take place on Dec 13. There was no immediate confirmation from Muslim leaders if they would come. Turkey currently holds the chairmanship of the OIC. The recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital and the moving of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  expected to be announced by President Donald Trump later Wednesday  would be a grave mistake against international agreements, Kalin warned. Jerusalem is our honour, Jerusalem is our common cause, Jerusalem is our red line, he added, urging the Trump administration to return from this grave mistake immediately. Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said the expected US move risked igniting a fire in the Middle East and will prove a great disaster. The recognition will throw the region and the world into a fire and its not known when it will end, Bozdag, also government spokesman, wrote on Twitter. Bozdag said such a step which showed great intolerance and mindlessness would destroy the peace process.",0
"Title: Turkey Files Complaint With WTO Over US Tariffs On Steel And Aluminum Products  Article: A second country has now filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization over the United States insistence on ramping up a trade war. Turkey, following in Chinas footsteps, filed the complaint after the US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum products coming from the country. Turkey has requested WTO dispute consultations with the United States concerning additional import duties imposed by the United States on steel and aluminum products. The request was circulated to WTO members on 20 August, the WTO said on Monday according to a report by RT. Turkey claims that the measures are inconsistent with a number of provisions of the WTOs Agreement on Safeguards and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, said a statement on the WTOs website. Back in July, the Chinese government lodged a complaint with the WTO over the USs implementation of tariffs on some of their goods. Ankara retaliated against the US by raising tariffs on 22 American-made products ranging from cars to tobacco. According To NPR, the WTO complaint comes less than a week after the Trump administration published a preliminary list of more than 6,000 Chinese products that it wants to hit with an additional 10 percent duty. The list targets products worth a total of $200 billion, ranging from an expansive range of seafood and vegetables to stones, metals, and plywood. SHTFPlan  Some of these tariffs are already having an effect on the wallets of Americans. The continual ramping up of an unnecessary and disastrous trade will only speed up the likelihood of a global economic collapse.",0
"Title: Farrakhan, Bari Weiss, Anti-Semitism and the Progressive Media  Article: There are two hot trends in the progressive media now. 1. Excusing Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam  2. Attacking Bari Weiss, a Jewish liberal New York Times columnist who called out anti-Semitism on the left, especially in the Women's March, whose leaders have praised Farrakhan  The two trends are one and the same. The same progressive media echo chamber is fighting to protect an anti-Semitic intersectional movement while attacking a Jewish woman who called it out. Examples of the former trend include, Why Tamika Mallory Wont Condemn Farrakhan at The Atlantic, Shaun King at The Intercept, ""A Word About Louis Farrakhan and Tamika Mallory"" at The Root, and Masha Gessen at the New Yorker. Some examples of the latter include the Neo-Soviet titled rant, ""A New York Times columnist blamed a far-left 'mob' for her woes. But maybe she deserves them"" by Avi Selk at the Washington Post, Ben Mathis-Lilley at Slate, an attack from Glenn Greenwald, the Hamas apologist at the top of The Intercept and the Bari Weiss Problem at The Outline. The former are filled with special pleading and the latter furious intolerance. We are expected to make special allowances for Farrakhan's black leftist fans while rabidly hating a Jewish woman whose real crime was challenging the leftist comfort level with anti-Semitism. Little more needs to be said. It's tediously predictable that the loudest attacks on Bari Weiss come from lefty columnists with Jewish last names. It's far safer to attack Bari Weiss than it is to stand up to Farrakhan.",0
"Title: Viking settlement 'Hop' is in New Brunswick, claims archaeologist  Article: A long lost Viking settlement known as 'Hop' is located in Canada, a prominent archaeologist has revealed. Seafaring Scandinavians built a settlement in North America more than 1,000 years ago, 500 years before Christopher Columbus, it is claimed. Three key things identify this mystical settlement - an abundance of grapes, salmon and canoes made from animal hide - according to legend. Now, one expert claims the only place that matches this description is the Miramichi-Chaleur bay area in northeastern New Brunswick in Canada. This would be the third Viking settlement claimed to have been found in North America, although it could be hard to conclusively prove the new theory. Scroll down for video  A lost viking settlement known as 'Hop' that was home to wild grapes and canoes from animal hides has been finally located, a prominent archaeologist has claimed (stock image)  Dr Birgitta Wallace, a senior archaeologist emerita with Parks Canada told Live Science that the illusive Hop may have referred to several seasonal settlements. In theories spanning several decades, researchers have suggested it could have been located in Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New York - among other places. Dr Wallace has pinpointed the location using descriptions from Viking voyages as well as archaeological work carried out at L'Anse aux Meadows, which was the first Viking settlement found in North America in the 1960s. The second, a site built between 800AD and 1300AD that was uncovered in Newfoundland in 2016, is the second, though scientists are yet to confirm it is of Viking origin.",0
"Title: These Are The Top Financial Concerns Of Ordinary Americans  Article: While institutional investors and money managers have a very specific list of worries when it comes to their ""financial concerns"" such as Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), monthly/quarterly performance and redemption requests, losing top traders, what the year end bonus will be, order fill slippage, being frontrun by HFT algos, what the Fed chairwoman may say any given day, whether it is 3:30pm or if it is a Tuesday, ordinary Americans have a far simpler list of concerns. According to a recent Gallup poll, the one thing that has most Americans very/moderately worried is ""whether or not they have enough money for retirement. "" The list of the top concerns is presented below: In a country in which the economy is barely sputtering, and where all the benefits from 5+ years of QE have accrued exclusively to the top 1% of wealthy, that nearly two-thirds of society is concerned about its retirement prospects will hardly come as a surprise. Going down the list, the next highest concern, not being able to pay medical costs in the event of a serious illness or accident, worries 53% of Americans. This is down from a record high of 62% in 2012. Third on the list of Americans' top financial worries is not being able to maintain the standard of living they enjoy, with nearly half of the country's adults citing this concern. Together, retirement savings, unexpected medical costs, and maintaining one's standard of living typically top the list of the eight financial items that Gallup has tracked annually since 2001.",0
"Title: Torontos Aid to Women saving babies every week  Article: News by Pauline Kosalka TORONTO, Ontario, November 16, 2010 (theinterim.com)  In the fight against abortion, there is a need to go beyond the legal dimensions and help those who are most vulnerable. Aid to Women, a pro-life crisis pregnancy centre in downtown Toronto, is an example of a successful organization that reaches out to individual women who are considering having abortions. Opened in the late 1980s, the organization has saved over 2,000 babies from abortion and continues to rescue an average of two to three babies per week. Aid to Women is right beside the Cabbagetown Clinic, an abortion facility on Gerrard Street. ""We're very blessed to be located there,"" Frances Keet, general manager and counselor at Aid to Women, told The Interim. ""We can see from one end to another who's coming in."" This allows the sidewalk counselors to quickly approach a woman or teen planning to have an abortion and encourage her to come to their office next door. From 7:30 to 11:00 a.m., the time when most abortions are conducted, Aid to Women provides sidewalk counseling. Workers at Aid to Women try to dissuade women going into the facility from having an abortion by informing them of fetal development, the abortion process and consequences. They also offer help to women coming out, handing out pamphlets and referring them to organizations specializing in post-abortion help.",0
"Title: Dutch Study Shows Patients Requesting Euthanasia Likely Depressed  Article: News By Hilary White LEIDEN, January 16, 2006 (LifeSiteNews.com)  A study published by Dutch researchers in the September 20, 2005 edition of the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) has shown that at least 50% of patients killed under the Dutch euthanasia programme were suffering from depression. In addition, 44% of those suffering from cancer showed clinical signs of depression when they asked for euthanasia. Titled, Euthanasia and Depression: A Prospective Cohort Study Among TerminallyIll Cancer Patients, the study reports that the risk to request euthanasia for patients with depressed mood was 4 times higher than that of patients without a depressed mood. The significance of the study is sharpened since the researchers themselves admitted to a strong bias against their own findings. The researchers at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands, wrote that they were uncomfortable with the idea that a request for euthanasia is a symptom of depression and that the patients request for suicide should be deferred until his depression was treated. The authors bias in favour of the Dutch euthanasia doctrine is clear: The patients wish to hasten death cannot be put on par with a well-considered and persistent request for euthanasia in an environment where euthanasia is customary. Our clinical impression was that such requests were well considered decisions, thoroughly discussed with healthcare workers and family. We thought the patients requesting euthanasia were more accepting their impending death and we therefore expected them to be less depressed.",0
"Title: Politicians for a new world order Calling for Gun Control through Banning Bullets  InvestmentWatch  Article: by Thinker The concept of banning lead was floated before, but this latest effort to impose back door gun control has all the marking of a tin horn dictator stripping the peasants of any means of resistance. Drop the pretense. All you need to know is WHY IS GOVERNMENT STOCKPILING GUNS, AMMO?, while you are being told you are not allowed to have your own horde. How you answer this question, reveals much about your attitude towards government, and level of concern for protecting yourself from tyrannical edits. It is startling just how much of the population will accept de facto gun control for any trumped up scheme to impose further governmental mastery. SCOPE reports on the recent announcement on M855 ammunition. On 13 February 2015, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATF) released a document [PDF ] that proposed the reclassification of 5.56mm constituent projectiles of SS109 and M855 cartridges from the category of primarily used for sporting purposes to that of armor piercing ammunition. The 17-page document was titled: ATF FRAMEWORK FOR DETERMINING WHETHER CERTAIN PROJECTILES ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR SPORTING PURPOSES WITHIN THE MEANING OF 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(17) and uploaded to ATF.gov , in part to enable interested parties to review it and submit comments before 16 March 2015.

"Title: Why The 2,776 NSA Violations Are No Big Deal  Article: Thanks to more documents leaked by Edward Snowden, this time to the Washington Post, we learned last week that a secret May 2012 internal audit by the NSA revealed 2,776 incidents of unauthorized collection of information on American citizens over the previous 12 months. They are routinely breaking their own rules and covering it up. The Post article quotes an NSA spokesman assuring the paper that the NSA attempts to identify such problems at the earliest possible moment. But what happened to all those communications intercepted improperly in the meantime? The answer is, they were logged and stored anyway. We also learned that the NSA routinely intercepts information from Americans while actually targeting foreigners, and that this is not even considered a violation. These intercepts are not deleted once discovered, even though they violate the governments own standards. As the article reports, once added to its databases, absent other restrictions, the communications of Americans may be searched freely. The Post article quotes an NSA official explaining that the thousands of unauthorized communications intercepts yearly are relatively insignificant. You can look at it as a percentage of our total activity that occurs each day.",0
"Title: Portland Braces For Blood In The Streets As Antifa Pledges Militant Antifascist Resistance Against Patriot Prayer On Saturday  Article: If Portland authorities do not intervene in a major way, we could potentially see one of the largest street brawls in modern American history on Saturday. On June 30th, an extremely violent confrontation in Portland between Antifa thugs and conservative groups made headlines all over the world, and now both sides have been hyping this August 4th sequel as an even bigger event.

On the other side, Eugene Antifa, Rose City Antifa, RASH NW and the Pacific Northwest Anti-Fascist Workers Collective are hoping to bring thousands of their own members, and one organizer publicly stated that they better bring our own guns too.

"Title: BLM Whistleblower Believes BLM Was In Violation Of Law Regarding Its Law Enforcement Authority at Bundy Ranch  Article: BLM Whistleblower Believes BLM Was In Violation Of Law Regarding Its Law Enforcement Authority at Bundy Ranch  Please help support us with cryptocurrency donations. Thank you! Washington State Representative Matt Shea spoke about the sealed hearings going on in Nevada concerning the Bundy Ranch trials last week, including a kill list, and hes back with an update in which a Bureau of Land Management agent is attempting to provide propaganda in an attempt to discredit former FLM agent Larry Wooten, who blew the whistle on the corruption, unprofessionalism and quite possibly, criminal activities of agents within the BLM. However, in revealing that information, it was also revealed that Agent Wooten believed the BLM was in violation of the law regarding its law enforcement authority. In the latest documents, BLM Agent Kent Klemen, who is a government witness in this case, makes an attempt to discredit Mr. Wootens claims. Keep that in mind, as Klemens first words are that the BLM was requested to remove Mr. Wooten from the Bundy Ranch investigation at the request of prosecutor Steven Myhre. And why did Myhre want Wooten removed? According to Klemen, Wooten had made recent statements that Wooten believes the BLM lacks law enforcement authority. Looks like someone was waking up in the Matrix . The request by Myhre came on February 17 of this year, and it was implemented on the 18th, just one day later, according to Klemen.

Steve Kings Constitutional Amendment will stop illegal immigrants from being counted as persons in the Census  California gets 4 extra House seats, 4 extra electora  Article: Did you know that every single illegal alien in this country implicitly votes? They dont necessarily vote by casting a ballot. They vote by residing in a state. For every human that goes to sleep and wakes up in a particular state, that state can measure them as a resident. This means a state like California that has 3 million illegal aliens benefits from the presence of criminals. Those people might not vote in an election. But they dont have to. They rely on liberals to elect liberal congressmen and just by being present they enable their legal liberal counterparts to send more liberals to Congress. They dont need to step near a ballot box once. That might stop soon thanks to a Constitutional Amendment, currently known as House Joint Resolution 30 (HJR#30) proposed by Representative Steve King (R-IA4). Article Continues Below That wasnt Rep.

"Title: Twitter crackdown on speech rapidly turning the platform into a mindless cesspool of conformist stupidity  Article: Twitter crackdown on speech rapidly turning the platform into a mindless cesspool of conformist stupidity Too many people are speaking their minds these days, and much of it is apparently too politically incorrect to allow on social media. This is the censorship position that Twitter is taking, anyway, as the 140-character message purveyor progressively unveils new Orwellian policies that aim to cull all forms of content that it determines to be hateful in nature. The changes, which concerned Twitter users are bringing to light using the hashtag #TwitterPurge, have already begun with the removal of obviously problematic content like non-consensual nudity and other forms of exploitative content. But the next phase of the purge, according to reports, is a lot less transparent, and could be used to target users who post anything that Twitters policy police determine to be offensive. As of this writing, the only information that Twitter has released about what it plans to remove next is that it will include Hateful Imagery and Hate Symbols. But what does this actually mean, and who gets to decide what constitutes a hateful image or symbol? So the only thing anyone who cares can do is wait until Twitter decides to provide further clarity as to the type of content it wishes to remove from its platform. Our media policy will be updated in the coming weeks to include hateful imagery and hate symbols, reads an obscure Twitter announcement about the upcoming new rules. This means that this content will no longer be permitted in avatars or profile headers. Tweets containing this type of content will be placed behind an interstitial.",0
"Title: British PM May Puts Britain First- Goes Hard Brexit  Article: Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE Brexit Britain and the U.S. tighter than ever. Welcome to the emerging new world order British PM May Puts Britain First- Goes Hard Brexit Taking a cue from soon to be President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Theresa May put the economic and financial interests of Britons ahead of its relations with their fellow Europeans. May went hard Brexit, that is, a complete break from her European partners. No half measures. In a recent speech, May clearly and without conditions or qualifications stated her governments desire to trigger Britains exit from the European Union and the single market within two years of the upcoming triggering date. May re-asserted that her countrys priorities were to gain complete control over its borders and its immigration policies. In other words, complete control over whom Britain wanted to admit or reject as immigrants to Great Britain. The European Union is based upon, inter alia, the free flow of European Union citizens among its various member states. As a EU member, it would be impossible and contrary to EU rules and regulations for Britain to prevent EU citizens from other EU nations from immigrating to Britain. May also wanted Britain to have complete sovereignty and judicial jurisdiction over its people and its companies. In other words, May wanted the British people to have nothing to do with the European Court of Justice, which had jurisdiction over EU members and their citizens. Similarly, though being a member of the EU customs union had its privileges, it had also its definite disadvantages: namely, the customs union set tariffs on goods imported into the European customs union bloc.",0

"Title: Climate change will get worse before it gets better: carbon combustion and catastrophic flooding.  Article: Be prepared to see more images like this in years to come. The recovery efforts from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria are barely underway, and it will be years before the full extent of the damage caused by four major hurricanes to make landfall in one season is known. However, we can already begin to see how severe the effects can be when two category 4 and two category 5 Hurricanes make landfall in quick succession: The last time the northern Leeward Islands experienced two major hurricanes in the same season was 1899, and now it is looking at three in the same month. Residents of some islands barely had time to assess the wreckage of a Category 5 hurricane before another bore down on them. Others fled their homes to escape Irma, only to find themselves in the cross hairs of Maria. A full reckoning of 2017s place in hurricane history will not be possible until the season ends on Nov. 30, but there are a few things we can say with reasonable confidence: It will almost certainly be the most expensive season on record in the United States. That distinction, like most others, currently belongs to 2005, when Katrina and three other major hurricanes caused more than $143.5 billion of damage in the country. But this year, AccuWeather estimated that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma might cost a combined $290 billion: two storms producing double the economic damage of four in 2005. The devastation caused by these storms, and the suffering that continues, especially in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, as well as several Caribbean islands, including Dominica and Barbuda, is overwhelming.",0
"Title: The White Man Won  Article: >Hey, Obama is half white, after all. We call him black, but the fact is, hes just as white as he is black, genetically speaking. Which is perfect. Some people think Abraham Lincoln had some African blood in him. Whether or not he did, two skinny tall guys from Illinois, both lawyers and state legislators, both coming from humble beginnings, went on to reach the presidency of the United States of America. The first one freed the black slaves, the second became the first black president. Though he is half white, we call him black. And yet we elected him, overwhelmingly. And, while that is certainly a victory for the black man in America, it is also a victory for the white man in America. For the simple reason that he has overcome his sordid history of racism. In that sense, it is a victory for us all. Even the racists that are presently seething in their hatred as they witness a history they never saw coming may eventually be changed. Why? Because, familiarity brings understanding. Although Mr. & Ms. Bigot may not see it today, eventually, they will have to admit that, hey, this guy is doing a pretty good job. (Because we know hell do a great job.) And theyll see him everyday in the news, conducting their nations business. The country will not turn communist. Obama will not invite Al Qaeda for dinner. They sky will not fall. They will, eventually, see that they were lied to, by their own party this man is no terrorist, he is a true, red, white and blue American. And like the prejudiced person living in a formerly all-white neighborhood, when the black family moves in next door, after some time passes and they get to know them a bit, the prejudice subsides.",0

"Title: Fire Brigades Union Takes First Step to Industrial Action Ballot  Article: Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! LONDON, ENGLAND(Marketwire  Sept. 14, 2011) - The Fire Brigades Union has told Ministers in the Government and devolved administrations to deliver fair pensions in the fire service and reject Whitehall plans for fire crews to pay more, work longer and get less. It is the first step towards balloting the unions 43,000 members across the UK. The plans also propose increasing pension contributions by between 3.2% and 6%, a move which will cost fire crews between 2,000 and 7,500 by 2014. Fire crews in the main pension scheme face the highest payments in the public sector, up from 11% to 14.2% for firefighters and 17% for fire officers who have taken promotion. The higher tier contributions increases of up to 6% start kicking in for thousands of junior officers based at fire stations from station managers upwards. The union described the increases as a tax on fire crews as part of a smash and grab raid on their pensions to help pay off the budget deficit. This deficit was triggered by the near collapse of the banks and the need for huge public borrowing to fund the bank bail out. The union has warned the increases will see an exodus from the pension scheme which relies on contributions coming in to pay the pensions going out.",0
"Title: Fellowship of the Minds  Article: Obama is going out with a determination to inflict as much possible terror on America as possible. From Daily Mail: President Obama is planning to transfer at least 22 additional Guantanamo Bay detainees out of the military detention center before he leaves office later this month, DailyMail.com has learned. The group being released will be drawn from those held at Guantanamo  who include an accused senior al Qaeda bomb-maker, the terror groups top financial manager, and two intended 9/11 hijackers, who have all been held in the Cuba-based U.S. detention facility for more than a decade. According to a military source briefed on the process, 22 detainees are being prepared for transfer out of the camp, also known as Gitmo, before January 20. Although the White House has not specified which inmates will be transferred out  or which foreign countries have agreed to accept them  it has indicated that this will be a priority for Obama in his final days in office. I cant speak to any individual notifications that have been made to Congress or give you a specific preview about upcoming transfers, said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. I think I would expect at this point additional transfers to be announced before January 20th. Obama will likely focus on moving the 23 detainees who have been cleared for transfer  a group that includes the alleged head of al Qaedas bomb-manufacturing operation in eastern Afghanistan, the head of al Qaedas Tunisian faction in Afghanistan, and senior weapons trainers. Those held in Guantanamo in recent years have been dubbed the worst of the worst by military and intelligence officials.",1
"Title: Lebanon is Israel's Iraq  Article: I am strongly opposed to the American invasion and occupation of Iraq. While I had agreed that Saddam Hussein was a regional threat and a tyrranical ruler and believed that a regime change needed to happen, and that would require force from outside Iraq. But I later learned that our invasion was based on a pack of lies, poorly planned, poorly executed, and justified by politicians with an agenda dangerous to America and the world. I see many paralles with Israel's invasion and reoccupation of Lebanon. I am not trying to beatify Hezbollah, or even call them the good guys, but the IDF intentions are being reverse swift boated by the American MSM into a war of good vs evil. The Bush misadministration had planned the inevitable invasion of Iraq long before 9/11 and long before UN inspectors came up empty. The case for war was based on lies and known faulty intelligence, while good intelligence was ignored if it didn't suit the need. These lies were sold to the American people, then to the international community through the UN. Bush finally got his war, and the lies became well known. But it didn't matter anymore, we were the good guys and had to stay the course at great cost in lives, dollars and reputation. All the while tens of thousands of Iraqis were killed and that nation sank into civil war. We are being told that Israel was minding its own business on its Lebanese border, until Hezbollah invaded Israel and fired some rockets at Haifa and other northern cities. Upon learning of the kidnapping Israel launched immediate attacks into Lebanon for the sole purpose of returning its two soldiers. That mission later expanded to stop the rocket attacks.",1
"Title: How the sexual revolution, multiculturalism, and identity politics radicalized liberalism  Article: OpinionAbortion, Homosexuality, Politics - U.S. Abstract August 30, 2013 (Heritage Foundation) - Beginning in the 1950s, a more radical form of liberalism emerged in the academy that sowed the seeds for the sexual revolution and multiculturalism. Neo-progressivism mobilized the New Left of the 1960s, transformed American politics, and continues to dominate the cultural and political conversation today. It combines what neo-progressives call personal politics (the idea that American citizens have a right to all forms of self-expression) and cultural politics (the idea that cultural groups are entitled to special status) together as the twin pillars of a new identity politics. As a result, citizens today have more, not less, freedom from government in the realm of sexual expression, and the American electorate has been fractured into various groups. In the past two decades, a new, more radical form of progressivism has taken over American social and political life, even finding its way into the White House. Fresh instances of this new progressivism appear every day. For example: At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, progressives officially supported same-sex marriage as a civil right and unofficially rejected the word God in their platform; President Barack Obama, labeled the First Gay President by Newsweek for his support of gay rights, has instructed the Attorney General of the United States not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act; and Vice President Joe Biden has said that discrimination against transgendered persons is the civil rights issue of our time. [1] The new progressivism divides Americans into categories of race, class, and gender.",1
"Title: Soros Buying San Diego DA Race  Article: Leftist billionaire George Soros is injecting big money into a San Diego district attorney race as part of his larger effort to install extremist prosecutors across America who will refuse to enforce inconvenient laws that liberals and progressives dont like. Soros, who turns 88 in August, has been underwriting district attorney races across America in an effort to dismantle the criminal justice system, empty the prisons, and sabotage the enforcement of immigration laws. Soros supports state and local efforts to resist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and wants to cripple police in order to advance the neo-Marxist abstraction known as social justice that simplistically breaks the world down into race, class, and sex or gender. Radicals claim that American laws and institutions are inherently corrupt and that these systems protect, for example, wealthy, white, native-born, non-disabled males at the expense of everyone else. Getting people who share Soross worldview into public office at every level is key to promoting his ugly vision of how America, which he calls the main obstacle to a stable and just world order, should look. Months ago Soros saturation-bombed his Open Society Foundations philanthropy with an $18 billion donation, likely guaranteeing OSF will remain one of the most important players in left-wing activism for decades to come. According to the New York Times, this was one of the largest transfers of wealth ever made by a private donor to a single foundation.

White House Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert admitted it. Axios: I recommend that today and tomorrow we use the general theme of supporting the governor and standing with the people of Puerto Rico to get them food, water, shelter and emergency medical care. Monday and Tuesday we can pivot hopefully to a theme of stabilizing as we address temporary housing and sustaining the flow of commodities and basic government services, including temporary power. After that we focus on restoration of basic services throughout next week and next weekend. Then we start a theme of recovery planning for the bright future that lies ahead for Puerto Rico. Planned hits, tweets, tv bookings and other work will limit the need for reactionary efforts. The storm caused these problems, not our response to it. We have pushed about as much stuff and people through a tiny hole in as short a timeframe as possible. In mid October, Mick and Marc will lead the effort to the Hill for more funds for emergency work, recovery programs and other offsets, and to replenish and hopefully reform the flood insurance program. In the meantime, we have plenty of ready money and another $$6+ billion will be released to FEMA October 1st as part of our last supplemental deal. Thank you, keep it up!

Unfortunately, President Obama's nominee to head the CIA, Deputy National Security Adviser John Brennan, has shown a tendency to fall for the bait from radical Islamists. Globally, he repeatedly expressed a hope that ""moderates"" within Iran and its terror proxy Hizballah would steer their respective constituencies away from terrorism. Domestically, he claims that radical Islam does not pose its own, unique threat to American security. He has helped strip language about ""radical Islam,"" ""jihad"" and similar terms from government vernacular, choosing instead to refer to ""violent extremism"" in an attempt to deny terrorists religious credibility. When it comes to jihad, he stubbornly maintains the word does not belong in conversations about terror, no matter what terrorists themselves say. Likewise, he also yielded to demands from American Islamists to purge law enforcement and intelligence training material of the terms ""jihad"" and ""radical Islam. "" Despite these positions, some American Islamists still oppose Brennan's nomination because he is considered the architect of the drone program which has killed scores of al-Qaida terrorists.

"Title: The Media Blames Everything But the Daily News' Leftist Slant for its Collapse  Article: If you're not a New Yorker, you probably know the Daily News largely from its desperate trolling covers. Lately this has involved badly photoshopped pictures of Trump devouring babies while wearing clown makeup supplemented by a Linda Stasi article calling for the murder of all Republicans. If you're thinking that this smacks of desperation, you're right. The Daily News is cutting much of its staff and pivoting to digital. Its long running feud with the New York Post is over. And the Post won. (Not that in the long run any paper can or will win.) But one of the many things that killed the Daily News was its hatred of Trump. Back in the day, it was a working class tabloid. Then it became a shrieky lefty troll while leaving its audience behind. The previous editor, Jim Rich, had been resisting pressure from management to soften the Trump covers, people familiar with the matter said. He was told they were diminishing an already much diminished print subscriber base, these people said, particularly among blue-collar readers in certain corners of New Yorks outer boroughs, where Trumps nationalistic populism apparently resonates in a way that is anathema to the citys cosmopolitan districts and immigrant enclaves... Now, many News staffers and alumni feel like the air has been sucked out of the room, and they are perhaps coming to terms with the notion that Trump is more popular with segments of their readership than they thought, even in deep blue New York. Problem solved. The latest death throes of the News occasioned shrill attacks on Tronc, which bought it for nothing, from its media allies.

DUPAGE, Illinois, September 15, 2011 (LifeSiteNews.com) - Rebecca was twenty-three years old, single, and enjoying a successful career as a professional dancer when she found out to her dismay that she was pregnant. The news couldnt have come at a more inopportune time. It was February of 2009, and Rebecca had just signed a contract with the Washington National Opera to dance for them from April to June of that year. I had to decide whether I was going to continue with the contract, or if I was going to step out because I was pregnant, the dancer, who wished to be referred to only by her first name, told LifeSiteNews in an interview. That was a really challenging decision to make, because I wasnt sure how much my body would show in the beginning. I was scared, nervous, and upset, she confided. Rebecca, who had been brought up in a pro-life, Christian home, now felt that she was faced with the agonizing choice of either ending her pregnancy or potentially ending her career. While married dancers do sometimes perform after having children, often by maintaining connections with the industry through their dancing husbands, Rebecca says the situation is not the same for single mothers.",0
"Title: Overweight German man who joined ISIS says they used him as sex slave  Article: Berlin | A 28-year-old German man who had officially joined ISIS forces in 2015 has recently escaped from Syria after he was allegedly turned into a sex slave by ISIS forces. The young man, who had converted to Islam in 2014, had pledged allegiance to ISIS hoping to become a full-fledged soldier in its war against Western civilization. Instead, he was rapidly turned into a sex slave for ISIS combatants, spending most of his time in captivity chained to a bed, dressed up as a Western-style woman and performing sexual services on ISIS soldiers daily until his recent escape. I went there to fight but I guess they had other plans for me, he told reporters, visibly ashamed.

At first, I thought it was all fun and games until I woke up one day chained to a bed, dressed in a robe with makeup and lipstick on my face, he recalls in horror. Dressed up like Marilyn Monroe Hermann Gottlieb, 28, says he was drugged the first week upon his arrival and woke up chained to a bed where he would spend most of his eighteen months of captivity.

Clapper, who served as DNI under President Barack Obama, and who has repeatedly disparaged Trump both before and since the 2016 election, called the Russian president a great case officer, which might be the only nice thing said about Putin by a former senior U.S. official in quite some time.

Later in the conversation, Clapper backtracked slightly, clarifying his remarks by adding Im saying this figuratively. It was not the first time that a former senior intelligence official rendered a judgment that Trump is an intelligence asset being exploited by the Russians. Back during the campaign, former Acting Director of the CIA Michael Morell wrote an op-ed for the New York Times entitled I Ran the CIA: Now Im Endorsing Hillary Clinton.

Would you like to share yours, as we do? (It looks pervasively evil and threatening, so far. ) From Euro-Med.DK, Sunday, September 26 (line breaks added) Summary: 140 heads of state and government have met at the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set up in 2000 to implement 8 global development goals by 2015  including halving poverty. Despite many fine words, obviously not much has been achieved, because poverty, hunger, lack of information, education and womens suppression, for example are deeply rooted in thousand-year-old traditions, especially Islam and corruption, rather than in lack of money, and because the western nations have realized this and the UNs ineptitude. The UN will not attack the underlying causes. Rather the UN is pursuing a classical communist ideology, grapping [grabbing] our money through secret taxes. Financial transactions and the harmless CO2 are the means to pass our money on to the IMF and World Bank (who loves its saviour, Al Gore) and who retain a great deal to themselves and throw a few dollars to poor countries, who cannot be helped anyway, because they are unable or unwilling to help themselves.The pretext is to help saving human lives.

"Title: The dirty truth about so-called family separations at the border  Article: Like nearly every issue of political importance to Americans, the problem of illegal immigration has been buried under such a load of histrionic horse manure that what isnt all that complicated a question is now harder to solve than the Riemann Hypothesis. Thanks to a series of inexplicable policy directions and legal decisions dating back to the 1997 settlement in the case of Flores v. Reno, itself a continuation of Flores v. Meese, we have managed to tie ourselves in a Gordian knot over the question of how to untangle the law on immigration. According to the supporters of immigration policy that would throw open the doors to every Tomas, Ricardo and Jorge who manages to sneak across our southern frontier, President Donald Trump is meeting potential immigrants at the border and literally tearing their children from their arms. The darling little moppets are then warehoused in cages like stray dogs. No one knows what happens to the kiddies next, but their fates probably involve either slavery, forced medical experimentation or outright murder in one of the concentration camps set up under the Trump regime. Its only thanks to the tireless efforts of Hollywood actresses, television comedians and other liberal activists that anyone even learned of Trumps twisted machinations.
