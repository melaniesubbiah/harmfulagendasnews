"Title: Kobach? Ratcliffe? Gowdy? (NOT Christie!) Trump MUST Choose Immigration Patriot To Replace Jeff Sessions | Articles  Article: President Trumps biggest challenge right now is deciding who will be his next Attorney General. Especially after the loss of the House, this decision is critical for immigration patriots. By all accounts, the acting Attorney General, Matt Whitaker, is a solid replacement to Jeff Sessions. Whitaker took the job upon the recommendation of immigration patriot hero Rep. Steve King, and he is reportedly intent on reining in special counsel Robert Mueller. But hes only temporary, and Democrats in Congress are determined to make sure this acting AG has the shortest tenure possible. [ Top Democrats Vow to Block Matthew Whitaker From Interfering in Russia Inquiry , by Sheryl Gay Stolberg, New York Times, November 11, 2018]  Trump may just want Whitaker to throw a wrench in the Mueller investigation and leave. Trump aides hope he will limit the scope of Muellers final report and protect Trump from a subpoena. It would be easier for a man not dependent on Senate confirmation to accomplish this task more than anyone else. [ Matthew Whitaker: An Attack Dog With Ambition Beyond Protecting Trump , by Adam Goldman, Michael D. Shear and Mitch Smith, New York Times, November 9, 2018]  The curtailment of the Mueller investigation would be welcome news to immigration patriots and conservatives generally. It would finally free up the President to focus on more important matters and clear up the impeachment cloud hanging over his head. Of course, that issue is not everything for immigration patriots. With the House in the hands of the Democrats, the chances of Republicans passing serious immigration reform in the next two years is practically nil.",0
"Title: Theology chairmans same-sex wedding begins flood of challenges to Catholic identity  Article: NewsCatholic Church, Faith, Homosexuality, Marriage July 8, 2015 (CardinalNewmanSociety) -- The Episcopalian marriage of Fordham Universitys theology chairman to his same-sex partner, just one day after the Supreme Courts marriage ruling, begins a new flood of challenges to Catholic identity that most Catholic colleges and universities are unprepared to face, warns Cardinal Newman Society President Patrick Reilly. Even if a Catholic college leader wants to uphold Catholic teaching on marriage, the persistent embrace of dissent and opposition to the Church at many Catholic universities makes it highly unlikely that the law will now permit them to uphold moral standards for professors, Reilly said. The fact that a theology chairman at a Catholic university apparently waited for the Supreme Courts ruling to publicly affirm his disregard for Catholic teaching is a sign that the sky has opened, and wayward Catholic universities are about to face a flood of consequences following upon decades of inconsistent Catholic identity. Dr. Patrick Hornbeck II was declared married at St. Bartholomews Episcopal Church in Manhattan, according to The New York Times.",1
"Title: Secession from Obama's America  Article: Is it a Field of Dreams or a Plea for Return to a Constitutional Republic? Last night I stumbled upon an article, A Case For Secession-Introduction, (first of a series) on Gather.com and it struck me that the time may soon be approaching when one or two states will be called to step up for the rest of us in hopes of saving the Republic. Im not advocating for secession now; Im just looking at the possibility with a little more interest. How such a move might shift our government back to position where Representatives actually have to listen to and respect their constituents is a question that interests me. What is clear is that with Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid in control, Democratic Members of Congress are currently being effectively bribed with earmarks, promises or threats to pass legislation America does not want. They are not listening. Polling demonstrates over and over the majority of Americans are against government run healthcare, are against unreasonable infringement of our Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms, are against illegal immigration, are against socialism, are against tax dollar funding of organizations like ACORN and SEIU, are against politicians creating unsustainable debt that will cripple their childrens futures, are against government manipulate of the news, are against government creating more unsustainable entitlements, are against Congress not adhering to the Constitution, are against Congress exceeding their power, are against Congress trampling on the rights reserved to the states under the Constitution, and are against unreasonable infringement of rights of privacy and free speech. In many states, the majorities are huge.",0
"Title: Iran-Contra scandal comes to light  Article: The Iran-Contra scandal that led to the indictment of several Ronald Reagan Administration officials and sullied Reagans presidency began to unravel on this date 31 years ago when CIA contract pilot Eugene Hasenfus plane was shot down in Nicaragua on October 5, 1986. The Iran-Contra scandal and ensuing outrage over it from the political establishment was nothing more than political kabuki. The gist of the scandal is this: The Reagan Administration concocted an arms sale deal with Iran that included arms-for-hostages and that violated an embargo against that nation. It also violated the Boland Amendment that prohibited U.S. funds from going to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. The U.S. was the largest seller of arms to Iran while the U.S. puppet dictator of Iran, Shah Reza Pahlavi, was in charge. The Shah had been re-installed to power through a CIA-backed coup 1953 and propped up by the U.S. and UK until he was finally overthrown by radical Islamist elements in 1978. Months later, supporters of the Iranian Revolution that forced out the Shah seized the U.S. Embassy in Iran, capturing 52 Americans. The hostage crisis would last for four 444 days. Among the many actions President Jimmy Carter took against Iran during the crisis was the installation of an arms embargo. That  along with U.S. support of CIA-installed Saddam Hussein in Iraq  made the Iranians, who were at war with Iraq, open to making a deal with even The Great Satan. The Deep State, meanwhile, was playing politics in Central America.",0
"Title: ISIS leader calls for the Impeachment of Donald Trump  Article: The leader of the Islamic State terrorist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has called for the American Congress to impeach Donald Trump. In a seven-minute video made available on the internet yesterday, the self-designated Caliph of the Islamic State in Irak and Syria criticizes the American President for his anti-Islamic behavior and policies and demands that impeachment procedures begin immediately. Mr. al-Baghdadi calls for the United States Congress and Senate to impeach Mr. Trump and replace him with a Muslim President. He says that if they fail to do so, the country will suffer Gods wrath. Allah disapproves of this fiery-haired devil and will strike down on America if it doesnt repent. Throughout the video, the terrorist leader used a very colorful language, calling Mr. Trump a pig, a dog, a man-whore and many other colorful names. This pork-eating infidel is a sex addict and a psychopath. He is an evil man who has no respect for women. Mr. al-Baghdadis numerous critics about Mr. Trumps treatment of women are particularly surprising, considering the fact that ISIS is known to practice sexual slavery on a large scale. The terrorist leader also criticizes Trumps possibly incestuous relation with his daughter as well as his relation with the Devil worshipper Steve Bannon. The month of May has been cruel to the Islamic State (ISIS) forces, as the terror organization has suffered several defeats in both Iraq and Syria. With a significant amount of ground lost already this month, the future looks rather bleak for the Islamic State.",1
"Title: Who Towers Behind Trump?  Article: The following detailed background on billionaire real estate developer, TV personality, author and GOP presidential candidate Donald J. Trump comes courtesy of an excerpt from Michael Collins Pipers book, The New Jerusalem: Zionist Power in America, which was published in 2004 by AMERICAN FREE PRESS. By Michael Collins Piper An inquiry into the background of flamboyant American entrepreneur Donald J. Trump provides some surprising insights into Trumps path to power and influence, for the fact is that Trumps rise to stardom came as a direct consequence of his having functioned as hardly more than a colorful front man for some very wealthy behind-the-scenes sponsors. Everyone knows, of course, about Trumps gambling operations and of the wide-ranging links of the gambling industry to organized crime. But the story is much bigger than that.",0
"Title: Cuba searches for national soul  Article: (Editors note: This is Part 1 of a special in-depth series on Cuba by Anthony LoBaido. Dont miss Part 2, Part 3 and Part 4. ) Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster.  German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche: 1844-1900 If the light in thine eye be darkness, how great is that darkness.  Jesus Christ, Gospel of Matthew 6:23 HAVANA, Cuba  Nobody has ever taken a boat from Miami to Cuba, so the saying goes when speaking of los balseros or the rafters. Simply put, there is a plethora of reasons why Americans dont defect to the Caribbean nation, just as South Koreans dont defect to North Korea and West Germans didnt defect to East Germany. Yet in past centuries people have defected to Cuba  white French agriculturalists fleeing the slave rebellion in nearby Haiti and black sugar cane cutters from Curacao searching for a post-slavery future. Several covetous American presidents tried to buy Cuba outright in cash. Former Soviets and modern Russians come to Cuba, as do millions of foreign tourists. The reasons for coming are legion, as are the recriminations and accusations Cubans and Americans lob at one another like errant missiles. Despite the rhetoric of a socialist paradise, complete with unrelenting sunshine, pristine white sandy beaches, exotic women, first-rate nationalized health care, universal education, racial harmony, sweet cigars and lively music, Cuba is only now coming to terms with her 21st century identity crisis. How can the island become a true utopia to which the best and the brightest people around the world permanently defect?",0
"Title: Why is the Left so Defensive of Obamas Religion?  Article: For once, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is in trouble for something he didnt say as opposed to something he did. Specifically, hes taking heat for his failure to defend Barack Obama when one of his supporters questioned his Christian faith. We have a problem in this country, said a man attending Trumps rally in New Hampshire Thursday night. Its called Muslims. We know our current president is one. You know hes not even an American  birth certificate, man  We have training camps growing, where they want to kill us. Thats my question. When can we get rid of them? Trump looked around. This is how were starting? After some laughs, Trump went on to say, Were going to be looking at a lot of different things. You know, a lot of people are saying that, and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there. Were going to look at that and plenty of other things. Not much meat on the bones of that answer, but that didnt stop a legion of liberal critics from slamming the GOP frontrunner. Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz issued a statement reading: Donald Trumps racism knows no bounds. This is certainly horrendous but unfortunately unsurprising given what we have seen already. The vile rhetoric coming from the GOP candidates is appalling. Others piled on, demanding to know why Trump didnt insist that Obama was both an American and a Christian. Likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was inspired to personally use her Twitter account to say, Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing, & just plain wrong.",1

That said, Davidson was tipped off to the letter by a previous Komen supporter turned non-supporter who had received it, so invitation-only isn't a failsafe system either. Is there any aspect of this new anti-women's-health fight that's been working out for conservatives? It's decimated the Komen Foundation, it's turned Congress into even more of a laughingstock (and we'll just contemplate, for a moment, just how ridiculous something has to be to make Congress look more foolish than it already does, on any given day), and it's turned transvaginal ultrasound into a household phrase. Rush Limbaugh's foray into the issue resulted in him getting plastered by an angry public and nervous advertisers. Still, they keep pressing on.",0
"Title: Why Wright Matters: Obamas on a Mission from God  Article: Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next! A REPUBLIC, IF YOU CAN KEEP IT. ~BENJAMIN FRANKLIN By Tom Rowan | May 20, 2012 | American Thinker When Elwood retrieved his brother Jake from Joliet prison, the two went on a pilgrimage to their childhood Catholic orphanage. Their pitiful orphanage was under siege from Chicagos infamously oppressive tax regime and was being put out of business. For inspiration, the brothers were directed to a Chicago Baptist church. The church was filled with laughter and love, song and dance, and miraculous divine inspiration that set the Blues Brothers on their own mission with a purpose: keep hope alive for Chicago orphans by paying off the corrupt Chicago regime. The movie rendition of an all-black Baptist church led by the charismatic James Brown preacher, thrilling his flock with high-spirited love and devotion, is what gave The Blues Brothers soul. This was what America imagined successful, loving black churches in Chicago looked like. No wonder, then, that Reverend Wrights scream for God to damn America is so jarring even to this day. Reverend Wrights sentiment and his rants do not belong in any American church. Getting people high on hating America and its so-called white oppressors is what carnival barkers like Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson do for a living. Most Americans still find it hard to reconcile the rage and the hate being preached at our presidents old house of worship. Christians get high on love, not hate. Christians are encouraged to be forgiving, not condemning. Christians seek to spread the good news and Christs commandment that [y]ou shall love your neighbor as yourself.",1
"Title: Atrocity Porn and Hitler Memes  Article: American and global audiences have been bombarded with media images of wailing children in holding facilities, having been separated from adults (maybe their parents, maybe not) detained for illegal entry into the United States. The images have been accompanied by gut-wrenching audio of distraught toddlers screaming the Spanish equivalents of Mommy! and Daddy! since, as any parent knows, small children never cry or call for their parents except in the most horrifying, life-threatening circumstances. American and world media have provided helpful color commentary, condemning the caging of children as openly racist atrocities and state terrorism comparable to Nazi concentration camps and worse than FDRs internment of Japanese and Japanese-Americans. Indeed, just having voted for Trump is now reason enough for Americans to be labeled as Nazis. Finally, the presumptive Hitler himself, also known as President Donald Trump, citing the pleas of First Lady Melania and First Daughter Ivanka, signed an Executive Order to provide for adults and (their?) children to be detained together. However, the order is unlikely to hold up in court, with sanctuary-minded states aiming to obstruct border enforcement the way Trumps earlier order on vetting arrivals from terrorism-prone countries has been crippled by the federal judiciary. His media and bipartisan political opposition will be happy only when all border violation detentions cease and America has gone full Merkel, starting with ending Trumps declared zero tolerance for illegal crossings and restoration of Barack Obamas catch-and-release policy.",1
"Title: We werent meant to feel shame, but in a fallen world its essential to human dignity  Article: OpinionCatholic Church, Family This is the fifth article in a series on modesty in a culture of shamelessness. LifeSiteNews published the first instalment on April 7, the second on April 8, the third on April 13, and the fourth on April 14. April 16, 2015 (LifeSiteNews.com) -- From September 1979 to April 1981, Pope John Paul II gave a series of sixty-three talks which became the foundation of what is now known as his Theology of the Body. In them he reflected on the meaning of the human person, sexuality, and Christian marriage. He taught that the second and third chapters of Genesis reveal core truths about man, for written there are original human experiences, which are always at the root of every human experience. We are made in Gods own image, he says, yet we do not know who we are unless we know who God is. In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eves love for each other was a mutual gift of their whole beings, a self-donation of their personhood made through free acts of their wills. The giving of their sexual powers, their masculinity and femininity, was in harmonious submission to this mutual giving. They desired, more than anything else, the good of their spouse, the good of the others entire being. It was total love. And the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed, says the author of Genesis. John Paul II pointed out that these passages do not express a lack but, on the contrary, serve to indicate a fullness of consciousness and experience. Shame came into existence only with the advent of sin in human nature, and at that point our first parents had not yet sinned.",0
"Title: What Happens If The Government Shuts Down Tomorrow? Goldman Explains  Article: With just over 24 hours left until the US Federal Government may be shut down on Friday night should Republicans and Democrats fail to reach a ""stop-gap"" spending bill, something which is increasingly likely after Mitch McConnell said he is ""planning for a government shutdown"", clearly a political gambit yet one which may backfire and result in precisely what it is meant to avoid, the question then is what happens next. Conveniently, this morning Goldman answers precisely that question. But first, here is how the vampire squid handicaps the odds of a government shutdown today: as Hatzius et al write, ""there appears to be a substantial chance of a government shutdown at the end of the week. At the moment, we believe the odds of a lapse in spending authority after Friday, January 19, stand at around 35%. "" Here Goldman appears unduly optimistic... WHITE HOUSE SOURCES PEG CHANCES OF GOVT SHUTDOWN AT 50%: FOX ... Although even at 35%, this is a surprisingly high number. Why? Well, because ""the high-profile nature of the immigration debate and the lack of consensus among Republicans raise the probability that congressional Democrats will oppose an extension of spending authority. "" So with odds high and rising, the chance of a misstep, especially with Trump's loose twitter-finger, is likely much higher than Goldman's oddsbefore Goldman explains what happens next, first a quick look at the history of government shutdowns. Shutdowns are rarebefore 2013, the most recent shutdown had ended in early 1996because a short-term extension is always a possibility if a long-term agreement cannot be reached.",1
"Title: Mortician arrested after spending 8 hours with penis stuck inside corpse  Article: A mortician from Savannah, in Georgia, was arrested this morning after his penis got stuck inside a dead mans rectum, causing him to get caught several hours later. 67-year old Alfred Mortimer Evans was laying on the body of a 47-year old car accident victim when his colleagues arrived this morning and he was visibly stuck in this awkward position. He immediately admitted that he had been in this position for several hours and asked his co-workers for help. Unfortunately for him, his colleagues were unable to help him and they had to call the emergency services. Joey Dunmore, one of the paramedics who was called on the site, described the scene in an interview with the Savannah Daily Herald. He was laying on top of the corpse with his pants around his knees. He didnt really seem to feel any pain, but he was obviously humiliated. It took paramedics more than an hour before they could free him, and he was then immediately arrested by officers of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department. 17 criminal charges have been filed against Alfred Evans, including indecent treatment of a corpse, disorderly conduct, indecent exposure and possession of illegal drugs. Since the accused has worked on the night shift at the Chatham County Morgue for 43 years, and the investigators believe he could have sexually abused several other corpses in the past, and they expect to file more charges over the next few days.

"Title: Aliens and Ancient Sumer  Article: Ancient Sumer has been the subject of debate for numerous years. According to the ancient alien theory it is there, in ancient Mesopotamia where everything began. Among the stories of incredible encounters, Gods, and technology which are part of ancient Sumerian culture, there are several stories which point towards an extraterrestrial origin. Then came the Flood and after the Flood kingship again descended from heaven. After kingship had descended from Heaven, begins our King List, there were five cities before the Flood whose eight fabulous kings ruled no less than 241,200 years. Following the hegemony of these five antediluvian cities, the document goes on to tell us: The Flood swept over everything. After the Flood swept over everything, and kingship had (once again) descended from Heaven, Kish became the seat of kingship. The Ancient Sumerians lived in Mesopotamia, between the Tigris and the Euphrates and represented a higher form of culture. They possessed very advanced astronomical knowledge and were able to perform calculations with 15 digits, that is, with numbers above 100 trillion. To compare it to other ancient civilization, I believe it suffices to say that the Greeks could not count above 10,000. The Sumerians who predate the Babylonians established modern civilization and culture as we know it. History tells us that the first ten Sumerian kings lived a total of 456,000 years, which gives us an average lifespan of 45.6 thousand years each! Each Sumerian city that was protected by a god.",0
"Title: Family Security Matters  Article: Debunking the Biggest Immigration Lies October 2, 2016 John Adams famously stated, ""Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence. "" Knowledge is power. Nations go to great lengths to steal the secrets of their enemies for a variety of purposes. Conversely, nations seek to protect their own secrets jealously and often provide false information, known as ""disinformation,"" to confuse and confound their enemies. A historic example of such disinformation was a military operation launched by the Allies during the Second World War known as ""Operation Fortitude"" also known as the ""Calais Deception,"" wherein the Nazis were convinced that the Allies would launch an attack as Pas de Calais when in reality, U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, was planning to attack German forces at Normandy to begin the liberation of France. The invasion at Normandy was given the code-name, ""Operation Overlord"" but history remembers it as ""D-Day. "" General Eisenhower and his colleagues were concerned that if all of the German forces were assembled in Normandy that Operation Overlord would fail. Consequently General George S. Patton created an illusory ""invasion force"" consisting largely of inflatable vehicles that, from the air, appeared to Nazi pilots to be an actual invasion force. It was aptly described as ""Patton's Ghost Army.",0
"Title: Why Not Execute Alcohol and Tobacco Dealers?  Article: Although about thirty countries have the death penalty for drug trafficking, only in China, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Vietnam are drug offenders routinely executed. Yet, the worst place to be caught drug trafficking is in the Philippines, where thousands have died in extra-judicial killings. In the United States, not only can some drug offenses result in life in prison, the sentence of death can be carried out on a defendant who has been found guilty of manufacturing, importing or distributing a controlled substance if the act was committed as part of a continuing criminal enterprise.

Then it was reported that Trump has privately told a number of people that he supports executing drug dealers.

Barbara and I are finishing up three weeks in Italy, and it's not a happy place. But, for a long time, it hasn't been nearly as happy as most Americans believed. It's a deceptive place, where suffering is usually hidden by tough language, considerable charm, and extraordinary music. Italians are very dramatic, and those who spend time there (Ive been at it for more than fifty years) often wonder if they are on stage or in the audience. Don't forget that, just beneath the apparently cheerful exterior, there has long lurked one of the oldest traditions of political assassination in the world, from Caesar to the mafia. Its always been a tough place, remember that Italy invented fascism. And Hitlers hero and inspiration was Mussolini. There are those who think that there is a fascist revival under way, but I dont see it. I see chaos, populism, and all manner of social and economic programs, the outcome of which is unknowable. As usual, Italy is testing the political waters, as it always has. Its Europes political laboratory. There's a new government, composed of big-talking leaders whose programs call for guaranteed minimum incomes,flat taxes, and much tougher border controls along the country's ocean borders.

"Title: Kim Jong-uns Peace Gambit  Article: It appears that the outreach to South Korea by North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, which began in the lead-up to and during the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, did not end with the Olympics closing ceremony. Kim Jong-un has just hosted talks with a high-level delegation from South Korea, led by its national security director Chung Eui-yong. The South Korean delegation came away believing that these talks have borne some fruit. A possible summit meeting between Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in was discussed, which could occur in late April at the so-called Peace House, which is located on the South Korean side of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone. In the meantime, the two Koreas have reportedly agreed to set up a telephone hotline between the leaders of both countries. The South Koreans also indicated that North Korea would agree to halt tests of its nuclear weapons and missiles in conjunction with opening talks with the United States on the denuclearization issue. According to Chung Eui-yong, the North Koreans are looking for a credible security guarantee and the end to military threats against it, in which case they believed they would not need to keep their nuclear arsenal. He claimed that North Korea was interested ""in an open-ended dialogue to discuss the issue of denuclearization and to normalize relations with North Korea."" Notably, Kim Jong-un is said to have withdrawn, at least for now, his insistence that the United States and South Korea suspend their joint military exercises as a precondition to any negotiations.",0
"Title: Polish Parliament to vote this week on new bill to ban abortion  Article: NewsAbortion WARSAW, Poland, January 10, 2017 (LifeSiteNews)  Polish pro-lifers are trying again to force a vote in Parliament to establish an abortion ban, with legislators facing an initial vote on a new bill January 12. In October, the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) killed a bill to ban abortion proposed by the Stop Abortion Committee. The bill was the work of a grassroots movement and, contrary to foreign press reports, was started neither by the Catholic Church nor by the government. The Polish democratic system enables a group of citizens to initiate legislation in the lower chamber of the Parliament, called the Sejm, by gathering 100,000 signatures. The citizens initiative on abortion received more than 450,000 signatures. Several organizations were behind the bill, including the Ordo Iuris Institute for Legal Culture and The Right to Life Foundation. The proposed law left punishing women who committed abortions to the discretion of judges, a provision rejected by some pro-life organizations. In response, the Polish Federation of Pro-Life Movements created a similar bill without legal responsibility for women, giving the pro-lifers a chance to ban abortions. Their bill was presented to the lower house of the Parliament in September 2016. The Polish Federation of Pro-Life Movements drafted it and sent it to the Sejms Commission on Petitions. The Ordo Iuris and The Right to Life Foundation recently supported their actions, and the bill will be voted on January 12. The failure of the Sejm to ban abortion in 2016 means that the 1993 law is still in place.",0
"Title: Blog: A remarkable provision of the omnibus bill  Article: Senator John McCain is leading the charge against language in the omnibus bill that allows the continued use of Russian rockets in our space launchings of U.S. military satellites. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain blasted colleagues for including language in the must-pass spending bill effectively allowing United Launch Alliance  a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin  to continue using Russian rocket engines to launch military satellites into space. The language in the bill mandates the competition be open to military space launch vehicle providers ""regardless of the country of origin of the rocket engine. ULA, which relies on Russian RD-180 rocket engines to power its Atlas V rocket, recently dropped out of the Air Force's GPS III Launch Services competition after the Pentagon refused to give the company some relief from the fiscal 2015 defense budget's ban on use of RD-180s for military satellite launches after 2019. But the new language sets the stage for ULA to re-enter the competition. It is a sad day in American history and that of NASA and other rocketry development efforts in the United States that we are outsourcing (to use an Obama term) our reliance on rocket propulsion. Much of this involves national security and military capabilities. Recall that it was this same president who reduced the capacity of NASA.

"Title: 509 unborn babies killed every day in UK as abortions increase nationwide  Article: NewsAbortion May 17, 2016 (SPUC) -- The latest abortion figures show that on average, 509 unborn babies were killed by abortion every single day in 2015 in England and Wales alone. The figures released today by the Department of Health show that the overall number of abortions taking place in England and Wales in 2015 was 0.7% higher than in 2014. In total, 185,824 abortions were performed on English & Welsh residents last year. Disabled babies especially vulnerable Additionally, the figures show a rise in repeat abortions and abortions carried out on the grounds of disability. There were 3,213 abortions for disability - a 3.7% increase on 2014. 38% of abortions were repeat abortions, performed on women who had had at least one abortion previously. Abortion funding 30% of abortions were performed in NHS hospitals, but more than two-thirds were sub-contracted to external clinics, run by abortion chains like BPAS and Marie Stopes. This figure has risen dramatically over the last 20 years and represents one of the key growth strategies of the abortion industry. In total, nearly all abortions (98%) were funded by taxpayers. Commenting on todays figures, Anthony McCarthy, a bioethicist said: ""Although the abortion industry would like us to get used to these figures, I think people not invested in it will be appalled that over 180,000 unborn children were taken from us last year, the vast majority for social reasons.

I took it on in the first fact check of the material. Now Harvard has delivered. ""Hurricane Maria killed more than 4,600 in Puerto Rico, not 64,"" USA Today blares. ""A New Study Says Nearly 6,000 Died In Puerto Rico,"" BuzzFeed shouts. ""Puerto Rico's Hurricane Maria Death Toll Could Exceed 4,000,"" the New York Times reports slightly more cautiously. 4,000, 4,600 or 6,000. Which is it? Hurricane Maria: 4,645 Died In Puerto Rico From Storm In 2017, NPR claims. Thats more specific. Except that the margin of error is plus or minus 3,852. Thats a sizable margin. Maybe 793 people or 8,498 people died Instead they surveyed 3,299 random Puerto Rican households, used the survey results to generate a death rate of 14.3 per 1,000 between September 20, the date the hurricane hit, and December 31. Thats over 100 days after the hurricane hit. I don't expect CNN to pay any attention to me. But Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post, the only fact checker who has any credibility and actually does serious open-minded search, also ran the numbers. In effect, the researchers took one number  15 deaths identified from a survey of 3,299 households  and extrapolated that to come up with 4,645 deaths across the island. That number came with a very large caveat, clearly identified in the report, but few news media accounts bothered to explain the nuances.... Steven Kopits of Princeton Policy Advisers, an advisory firm, is a critic of the Harvard study. He notes that theavailable registry data, which still is incomplete, indicates 654 excess deaths above the previous year through December.",0
"Title: Yes, Catholics Can Vote For Trump | Blog Posts  Article: I asked a friend who is a Catholic priest whether a Catholic can vote for Donald Trump without committing a mortal sin, given his political shifts, shakiness on abortion and the things he has said and done. Answer: Yes, a serious Catholic can vote for Trump. And given what my friend said, I add this: anyone who cares about the unborn can safely vote for Trump because he will attempt to stop the immivasion of pro-abortion Democrat voters. A Catholic can vote for Trump, my friend says, because Trump is a Republican. Being a Republican, he will bring seven or eight thousand people to Washington, many or most of whom will be pro-life. I dont think Trump is pro-abortion, except for the so-called exceptions. But the exceptions are not a federal matter, anyway. Its the states that determine those things. The Constitution is never going to list the exceptions. Rubio is just the understudy for Jeb. Voting for Rubio is a vote for the Bush crime family. Cruz is a weirdo. [A friend] told me that in the 1980s, Reagan and Jesse Helms were working together on a major pro-life bill, in which Congress would have declared personhood. This would have overturned Roe v. Wade. People at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops told [the friend] that the bishops were against it, because they were afraid that if Reagan did something major against abortion, too many Catholics would become Republicans. The bishops lobbied in Congress against the idea. No other candidate is serious about the Mexican-Muslim invasion. Trump is the only candidate promising to do something about it.",0
"Title: It's Time For An Adult Conversation  Article: It's Time For An Adult Conversation (Before It's News) By February 2011, now just over four months away, America will know whether the Republican Party that they have returned to power in the House, along with the increased number in the Senate, truly are a new breed of Republicans (or rather, a return to the traditional Republicans of the pasttrue limited government, low tax conservatives), or whether we have the same mess as before in new packaging. To be sure, Republicans are unlikely to accomplish much in 2011 and 2012, at least from an administrative standpoint. Even if they regain a majority in the House (very likely) and Senate (an outside possibility requiring all the stars to align), they are still faced with an opposition president wielding veto power, a president who has vowed that there will be hand-to-hand combat in Washington if Republicans win. Despite his lofty rhetoric of ushering in an era of true bipartisanship, Obamas latest comments reveal what most of us already knew. Namely, that bipartisanship to Democrats means Republicans must vote for everything that the Democrat majority passes or be labeled as obstructionist. This is the same president who, shortly after taking office in January 2009, and when facing Republican opposition to the stimulus package, repeatedly reminded Republicans that hed won the election. Therefore, the implication being, America has accepted his goals and his agenda and there will be no compromises.",1
"Title: Will we bomb Iran for the women?  Article: The American war party continues to itch for an excuse to make war on Iran and has now dusted off an old playbook in its latest effort to get one started. The plan is simple. Foment a seemingly organic round of protests. Create a cause that will pluck at American heartstrings. Use chaos agents, bad actors, agents provocateur and operatives to either instigate violence from the state security apparatus or use violence and procured weapons to make it appear the state security apparatus has begun violent repression. Then employ American media to use video to transmit compelling images relating to the chosen cause and detailing the violent oppressive actions. Sit back and wait for Americans to clamor for government to do something. It worked in Libya, Syria and Ukraine. Will it work in Iran? While the Iran protests that began in the waning days of December seemed to be dying down in recent days, the protest movement may gain some stream today after Friday prayers. These so-called revolutions are pre-planned actions by globalist institutions like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institute, the neocon think tank funded by fascist globalist corporations. In the CFR-linked Project for a New American Century, the war party outlined its plans for manipulating actions in the Middle East and bringing down the regimes in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Iran  among others  and installing puppet regimes back in 2000. Its the blueprint George Bush the lesser used to blow up Iraq as part of the so-called War on Terror, a blueprint in place even before 9/11 occurred, as General Wesley Clark revealed.",0
"Title: Erdogan's Threat to Jerusalem  Article: In an unprecedented move, President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday, December 6, 2017, that the U.S. recognizes Jerusalem as Israels official capital. In an almost 20-minute speech, President Trump said, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Trump added, For more than two decades previous presidents have signed a waiver to delay moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, and while previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver, today, I am delivering. Turkeys dictator, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is at it again, threatening Israel with cutting off diplomatic relations should the Trump administration recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital. In a meeting with a parliamentary group of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), Erdogan stated that, This (referring to U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital) could go as far as cutting our diplomatic relations with Israel. You cannot take such a step. He furthermore warned the Trump administration that recognizing Jerusalem would be a red line for Muslims. He suggested that Turkey will take measures in the event of a possible U.S. move, including the convening of the 57 nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Istanbul. Erdogans bluster regarding President Trumps announcement on Jerusalem included such a far-fetched statement as, Such a move would not only be a violation of international law, but also a big blow the conscience of humanity.",0
"Title: The Just Firing of Andrew McCabe  Article: Based on the recommendation of career officials in the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe late Friday for good cause. The dismissal occurred less than two days before McCabe was planning to retire and become eligible to receive lucrative pension benefits. ""After an extensive and fair investigation and according to Department of Justice procedure, the Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) provided its report on allegations of misconduct by Andrew McCabe to the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR),"" Sessions said in a statement Friday. ""The FBI's OPR then reviewed the report and underlying documents and issued a disciplinary proposal recommending the dismissal of Mr. McCabe. Both the OIG and FBI OPR reports concluded that Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor  including under oath  on multiple occasions. The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability. As the OPR proposal stated, all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand. Pursuant to Department Order 1202, and based on the report of the Inspector General, the findings of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility, and the recommendation of the Departments senior career official, I have terminated the employment of Andrew McCabe effective immediately.",0
"Title: Muslim Crime Stopper Sofian Zakkout's New Crush: Anti-Semite Pastor Steve Anderson  Article: For nearly two millennia, Jews have suffered persecution after persecution at the hands of those who used religion as a vehicle for hate and even mass murder. Recently, a video clip of anti-Semitic pastor Steve Anderson  making the claim that Jews have experienced such abuse because they have somehow been cursed  wound up on the personal Facebook page of South Florida Muslim leader Sofian Zakkout. According to Zakkout, who sits on the boards of two anti-crime groups, Andersons declaration makes a lot of sense. With statements like this from Zakkout and worse, why would groups committed to fighting crime continue to compromise themselves and sabotage their mission by affiliating with him? Sofian Abdelaziz Zakkout is the President of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), a prominent Islamic organization headquartered in North Miami Beach, Florida. On January 25th, Zakkout posted onto his personal Facebook page a video clip of a speech made by Steve Anderson, the pastor of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona. Anderson is notorious for calling for the killing of gays to end AIDS. In the clip, Anderson states the following: And the Jews were scattered into all nations for literally 2000 years, right? For 1800 sum odd years. And by the way, everywhere they were scattered, they were persecuted, hated, treated badly. Why? Cause Gods blessing them? No. Cause theyre under the curse of God for having rejected the Lord Jesus Christ. Blaming Jews for the extreme torment they endured for so long, which includes a Nazi Holocaust that took the lives of six million innocent Jews and so many others, is incredibly offensive.",0
"Title: First Baby Born in Texas with Zika-Linked Microcephaly  Article: Texas public health officials confirmed the birth of a baby boy in Harris County with Zika-linked microcephaly, the congenital birth defect where a newborns head and brain are only partially developed. This marks the first live birth of a baby with Zika-related microcephaly in the Lone Star State. Microcephaly is one of the worst tragedies related to Zika virus infection. We are sad to report that we now have our first case of Zika-associated microcephaly and our hearts go out to the family, said Umair A. Shah, MD. MPH, executive director of Harris County Public Health (HCPH). advertisement The birth defect stunts the developing babys brain and head from growing fully. With its link to microcephaly, Zika poses a serious threat to unborn children. Its heartbreaking. This underscores the damage Zika can have on unborn babies, said Dr. John Hellerstedt, Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) commissioner. Our states work against Zika has never been more vital. Texas DSHS educates women and families about how to protect themselves from Zika through its Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program. They work closely with other state agencies to emphasize precaution at schools, daycare centers, and in womens health programs. Houstons KHOU 11 (CBS) reported the mother is from Colombia where she likely was infected and the baby contracted the infection in utero. She came to Harris County during her third trimester of pregnancy. Neither baby nor mother are contageous and there is no additional risk in Texas. However, when she was tested, the results came back as inconclusive.",0
"Title: Antidepressants burden users with extreme side-effects  Article: SSRIs make 1-in-4 people 'more anxious, rather than less' New studies link SSRIs to language disorders in children; sleep disruption and dementia in the elderly (NaturalNews) There is a growing body of evidence indicating that taking SSRI antidepressants is far more dangerous than previously thought  both in their psychological and physical effects.A group of former antidepressant users recently appeared before the British Parliament to relate their experiences of extreme side effects while taking SSRIs. Their testimony included everything from suicidal behavior to seizures and othercaused by the antidepressants.Several former SSRI-prescribed patients told their stories to the BBC, including Claire Hanley, who suffered severe symptoms when her doctor increased her tablet dosage:""I was getting seizure-like symptoms, where my muscles were jolting around of their own accord. ""Within two weeks I'd tried to take my own life twice. ""I felt disorientated and sick and had digestive problems and infections, it was really extreme. I don't even know how to begin. All I can remember is being on the bedroom floor in a kind of semi-conscious state having seizure after massive seizure. ""Twenty years later, Hanley still suffers from long-term side effects caused by the original prescription of SSRIs.The medical establishment has maintained that only about one in 100 people experience severe side effects from taking SSRIs, but many experts are suggesting that the number of people negatively impacted is far higher.Professor David Healy of Bangor University said that SSRIs make one in four people ""more anxious, rather than less.",0
"Title: Are You Prepared For The War To End All Wars?  Article: All signs point toward an upcoming large-scale Israeli/U.S. attack on Lebanon and Syria and all the sycophantic mainstream media are manipulating the public as we speak to gather support for a war to end all wars. The Greanville Post reported that as the media prepares the feast (war), what well be fed is being revealed. Russia and Iran are the main course, with Lebanon and Syria, who will be devoured first, as the hors-doeuvres. As always, the media play along as if they dont yet know whats coming. Everyone in the know (global elitists) knows what is happening, just not exactly when they can pull it all together. And the media awaits this war with baited breath as they count down to the dramatic moment when they can report the incident that will compel the innocent to attack the guilty. Anyone with half a brain can see the greatly increased anti-Russian propaganda of the past few weeks. This has happened as the Russia-gate claims have fallen to pieces, as former CIA analyst Raymond McGovern, the late Robert Parry, Paul Craig Roberts, and others have documented so assiduously. All across the media spectrum, from the big name corporate stenographers like The New York Times, CNN, National Public Radio, The Washington Post to The Atlantic and Nation magazines and other leftist publications such as Mother Jones and Who What Why, the Russia and Putin bashing has become hysterical in tone, joined as it is with an anti-Trump obsession, as if Trump were a dear friend of Putin and Russia and wasnt closely allied with the Netanyahu government in its plans for the Middle-East.

"Title: American Border Patrol Feature  Article: Trump: Moving toward border accountability? ~~~ /// ~~~ Blas Nunez-Neto --The Rand Blog -- December 9, 2017 The Big Border Security Question The U.S. needs a better understanding of the number of illegal border crossings A U.S. senator I once worked for was fond of saying that you can't manage what you can't measure. This old management adage holds true across a variety of disciplines, and is something that members of Congress should keep in mind as they debate what a secure border looks like and what kind of security measures are needed along the U.S. border with Mexico this fall. Despite investing billions of dollars since 9/11, it is still a struggle to measure how effective U.S. border security operations are. The Department of Homeland Security has decades of statistics concerning apprehensions made by Border Patrol agents, which have reached modern lows in recent years. However, apprehensions are output measures  what they actually measure are the activity of the Border Patrol. They tell us very little about how the Border Patrol is actually performing. In fact, over the years DHS officials have sometimes pointed to both increases and decreases in apprehensions as evidence that the Border Patrol is being more effective. In order to actually understand how effective Border Patrol operations are, however, you need to know the number of people that attempted to cross the border illegally.",0
"Title: Man hospitalized after boyfriends fist gets stuck in his anus  Article: San Mateo, CA | A Californian man is being treated at the San Mateo Medical Center after his boyfriends fist was stuck for a painstaking 14 hours in his own rectum. The couple who were allegedly practicing fisting, a sexual activity that involves inserting a hand into the partners rectum, called 9-1-1 after they were unable to release the mans hand from his boyfriends anal cavity. Both men were transported by ambulance to San Mateo Medical Center where hospital staff successfully released the mans hand only 14 hours later, a complicated task due to heavy inflammation, blood loss and risk of laceration, say doctors. I know Ill never have the opportunity to give birth in my lifetime, but I think I know what it feels like now Mathew Cunning, 23, told reporters. I just talked to my mom on the phone and she told me she had felt the same thing when she was in labor, he admitted. My mom was really supportive through this whole ordeal. She talked to me on the phone the whole time the doctors were trying to get Hernandos hand out of there. Shes just the greatest, he added in tears. Out of lubricant The couple firmly believes that, had they used lubricant, the trip to the hospital could have been avoided. I usually use Crisco or vegetable oil but we were out of everything. It was definitely not our lucky day admits Iglesias, visibly amused by the media attention. It happened so fast. One second, we were cuddling and enjoying ourselves, and moments later, were in an ambulance and my fist is stuck in Matts butt. It was unreal, he recalls. Matt is a real hero, he handled the pain like a real soldier. The hospital staff was awesome.",0
"Title: Planned Parenthood Workers That Reached Abortion Sales Quota Goals Were Rewarded With Pizza Parties  InvestmentWatch  Article: By Michael Snyder Could you imagine having a job where you had to meet an abortion sales quota every month? According to a shocking new investigation, this was actually happening at Planned Parenthood clinics all over the nation, and workers that reached abortion sales quota goals were rewarded with pizza parties and other incentives. Every year, Planned Parenthood murders hundreds of thousands of precious little children, but that isnt good enough for them, and so they have their workers aggressively push abortions to the vulnerable young women who come into their facilities. It is a national disgrace, and Planned Parenthood should be defunded by Congress immediately. But of course Planned Parenthood was never defunded after it was revealed that they systematically harvest baby parts and sell them off to the highest bidder, and so many observers are pessimistic that they will be defunded now. In this video, women that used to work for Planned Parenthood explain how the abortion sales quotas worked. This is evil that is on a level that is hard to put into words America will never, ever be great again as long as this kind of thing is allowed to happen. As you can see in the video, former Planned Parenthood center manager Sue Thayer says that if the number of abortions got too low pressure was really put on the workers to get the number back up to an acceptable level It was on this big grid, and if we hit our goal, our line was green. If we were 5 percent under it was yellow, if we were 10 percent under it was red. Thats when we needed to have a corrective action plan  why we didnt hit the goal, what were going to do differently next time, she said.",1
"Title: World Ignores Slaughter of Christians  Article: By Victor Thorn  Thousands of Christians are being slaughtered in the Middle East, but President Barack Hussein Obamas White House refuses to do anything to help put an end to it. Some innocent victims face mass executions from firing squads. Others are drowned. The most unfortunate die from gruesome beheadings and crucifixions. Christian women are kidnapped, raped or threatened with being sold into slavery by their abductors. Meanwhile, Christian churches keep disappearing from the Middle East after being demolished and ransacked. Recently, radical Islamic State jihadists released a video in which they tossed Bibles and other Christian artifacts into a raging bonfire. As this onslaught against the worlds largest faith unfolds, the Obama administration has inexplicably remained passive. While Pope Francis, the United Nations, the Knights of Columbus, the European Council, and Congress have all called these atrocities genocide, the Obama White House has thus far failed to acknowledge it. Obama spokesman Josh Earnest has relied on semantics and wordplay to avoid discussing the subject. In February 29 press briefing, Earnest determined that, at least according to their standards, My understanding is, the use of that word [genocide] involves a very specific legal determination that has at this point not been reached.",1

[Top Afghan police chief killed, 2 Americans wounded in Kandahar attack, by Nick Paton Walsh, Barbara Starr and Ryan Browne, CNN, October 18, 2018] Some reports indicate that the killer was an Afghan bodyguard, meaning exactly the type of person whose job it is to prevent these kinds of attacks. Seventeen years after intervening in Afghanistan, we cant even assume a bodyguards loyalty to the countrys top officials. Meanwhile, a column of at least 7,000 migrants is heading towards our southern border.

However, this presupposes that there is nothing we can do to stop them ourselves.

After all, President Donald Trumps most iconic campaign promise was to build a wall on our southern bordera wall that we were told was going to be built quickly. Now nearing some tough midterm elections, no wall has been built. We were also told Mexico would pay for the wall. Even if Mexico does not give us wall money directly, we could still make the nations exporting their people to our country pay by slapping on a remittance tax. Yet for some reason, that idea has gone away. Why? Theres a fundamental premise underlying both of these stories.",1

The plague of Islamic terrorism is based on grievances against Israelso says Al Azhar, the worlds most prestigious madrasa (or Muslim university) that co-hosted Barrack Obamas 2009 A New Beginning speech. During a recently televised Egyptian interview, Ahmed Al TayebAl Azhars grand imam, once named the most influential Muslim in the worldsaid:  I have noticed that they are always telling us that terrorism is Islamic. All those mouthpieces that croakout of ignorance or because they were told tothat the Al-Azhar curricula are the cause of terrorism never talk about Israel, about Israels prisons, about the genocides perpetrated by the Zionist entity state. If not for the abuse of the region by means of the Zionist entity, there would never have been any problem. The Middle East and the region would have progressed, and the Arab individual would have been like any other person in the world, enjoying a good life, or at least enjoying the right to live in peace. Theres certainly much to comment on here. First, Al Azhar has in fact been exposed time and time again teaching the same anti-infidel and supremacist doctrines that groups like the Islamic State rely on. After being asked why Al Azhar, which is in the habit of denouncing secular thinkers as un-Islamic, refuses to denounce the Islamic State as un-Islamic, Sheikh Nasr, a scholar of Islamic law and graduate of Al Azhar, said:  It cant [condemn the Islamic State as un-Islamic]. The Islamic State is a byproduct of Al Azhars programs. So can Al Azhar denounce itself as un-Islamic?",0

Paul Ryan saw the writing on the wall  who's next?, the piece is not so different from James Kirkpatricks Ryanism Is Dead, But Has It Killed Trumpism? Robin noticed that:  Instead of the major assault on entitlements and welfare that Ryan had promised, he and his fellow Republicans have pushed through a domestic budget to make Barack Obama proud, as Russell Berman wrote in the Atlantic. The GOPs $1.3 trillion budget increases funding for Pell Grants, Head Start, the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Department of Education, Health and Human Services and renewable energies. It includes no cuts to the EPA, Planned Parenthood, or sanctuary cities.

David Milbury, a father of three from Athens in Ohio, was reported missing on Christmas last year after he left the house to prepare a surprise. A police investigation had been launched but, despite the help of the Athens County Sheriffs Office and the FBI, it hadnt been able to locate the missing man. Yesterday, his wife hired a professional sweeper to clean their houses chimney and the poor man made a gruesome discovery. In an interview with ABC, Jonas Forsythe said that what he saw in this chimney would haunt him for the rest of his life. I began sweeping as usual, but something was stuck in the vent. I pushed really hard, and I heard a loud noise. I came down to see what it was, and I saw that a body wearing a Santa costume had fallen in the fireplace.

"Title: Going after Grover Norquist's Taxpayer Protection Pledge  Article: Caveat: I'm not particularly knowledgable about economic stuff. Worse, I may not even be very smart about economic stuff! I tend to think taxes on middle class families, and below on the economic scale, are probably as high as they should be.I know that historically, income taxes are low, but what matters to people is whether or not they can make ends meet without completely stressing out. Since people's purchasing power has declined, at least psychologically they would not feel like they should carry the same percentage tax burden that they carried 35 years ago. While I can't say that I'm particularly fond of the idea of taxing rich people more, either, if it's necessary, I don't have a problem with that. And, as we've read these past few weeks, some bona fide rich people have no problem with that, either. (Sorry, don't want to search for a reference. ) We also know that even most Republican rank-and-file don't want Medicare or SS cut. While I don't think I've seen polling, directed to Republican rank-and-file, which asks, ""Would you be willing for taxes on rich people to be raised, possibly up to a limit of X%, if it meant preserving Medicare and SS during a prolonged recession?",0
"Title: Boy Raised by Apes Discovered in Malaysia  Article: Borneo| Malaysian authorities have announced this morning that they had finally been able to capture the feral child of Borneo that had been reported by hundreds of different villagers of the region over the last two last two years and had become the focus of the local media recently. The young boy had been reported to accompany a group of Bornean ourangutans that seemed to have adopted him as one of there own. We are trying to establish the actual age and identity of the boy explains Osman Mahmat Rahman, public relations officer for the Royal Malaysia Police (RMP). The boy is extremely nervous and aggressive when approached by humans and that made his capture quite complicated, especially since the other ourangutans attempted vigorously to defend him. We had to tranquilize three of the adult apes using darts filled with sedatives, before we could lay our hands on the child. We really went to great lengths to make sure we did not injure him during the operation. The boy was immediately taken to the hospital and was put under the custody of agents from the Social Welfare Department. A preliminary evaluation realized by doctors at the Borneo Medical Center, allowed to determine that the boy was in suprisingly good health considering the circumstances, having grown rather normally and showing no signs of malnutrition.",0
"Title: Runoff Time! Texas goes back to the polls next week  Article: TX-Sen: There's not a whole lot to write about the Democratic runoff. Former state Rep. Paul Sadler faces off with political unknown Grady Yarbrough, who hasn't made any filings with the FEC and doesn't even have a website, in a race in which Sadler should win pretty handily -- but it's been nearly impossible to get a read on the Texas Democratic primary electorate. (After all, it was a shocker that Yarbrough even made it to the runoff to begin with; most thought that Sean Hubbard would join Sadler in the runoff. ) But, assuming Sadler does win, he's probably going to get swamped in the general election by whomever prevails in the Republican runoff between Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst and former state Solicitor General Ted Cruz. The Dewhurst campaign, in spite of raising and spending $$24 million, is showing just how difficult establishment Republican politicians have it these days. Dewhurst is a conservative, no doubt, but to the Teabaggers he's not conservative enough because as Lieutenant Governor, he actually had to get bills passed through the state Senate and couldn't just sit back and vote against anything that included a ""tax"" or some sort of ""government spending."" After all, the state of Texas needed to have policies set. Unlike, say, Ted Cruz, who when not serving as Solicitor General has mostly been a private citizen and therefore can say ""I've never voted for a tax increase or a spending increase and I never will!""",0

The survey of 2,000 people by ORB found that 55 per cent believe the UK should leave the EU (up four points since our last poll in April), while 45 per cent want it to remain (down four points). These figures are weighted to take account of peoples likelihood to vote. It is by far the biggest lead the Leave camp has enjoyed since ORB began polling the EU issue for The Independent a year ago, when it was Remain who enjoyed a 10-point lead. Now the tables have turned. Even when the findings are not weighted for turnout, Leave is on 53 per cent (up three points since April) and Remain on 47 per cent (down three). The online poll, taken on Wednesday and Thursday, suggests the Out camp has achieved momentum at the critical time ahead of the 23 June referendum.",0
