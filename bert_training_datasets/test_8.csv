"Title: Hows your Financial I.Q.? Take the test!  Article: Americas federal, state, and city governments are profligate and irresponsible with taxpayers money, over-spending themselves into declared and undeclared bankruptcy, and a national debt that now exceeds Americas GDP. But if we, the American people, are better managers of our own finances, not only would more of us realize the financial black hole government is in, we would also demand more fiscal prudence from officialdom. Alas, Hadley Malcolm reports for USA Today, April 24, 2012, that despite the recession, most Americans still know NOTHING about their finances, especially young people. Here are the facts: Americans in their 20s hold an average debt of about $45,000, which includes everything from cars to credit cards to student loans to mortgages, according to a PNC financial independence survey released last month. At the same time, Americans 18-29 year old have a much higher jobless rate of 12.4% , well above the national rate of 8.2%. Financial literacy is especially needed for young Americans because they face an increasingly complex global economy that is credit-driven and puts more responsibility on individuals to plan for and manage their retirement accounts. But too many young Americans are financial illiterates. A biennial survey by Jumpstart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy found that U.S. high school seniors scored an average of 57.3% on a 31-question financial literacy exam in 1997.",0
"Title: Vice President Clark?  Article: Most people know the rumors, Clark almost was Kerry's VP in 2004. The problem then with Clark in general was the party didn't feel he had paid his dues. So, the slot went to John Edwards. Who by all accounts deserved being nominated. But, in the outgoing interview the former DNC Chairman was asked why in two words we lost the Presidential Election in 2004. His response, ""National Security"". We had the advantage in 2008, I think but there is nothing in life that is a guarantee. We need to have someone on the ticket who has National Security experience. Unfortunately, most of the leading contenders do not. That's okay, there is no requirement in our constitution to have military or National Security experience to be the Commander in Chief. But isn't it going to be useful in 2008? Aren't we going to have one hell of a mess on our hands? Isn't it going to be easier to convince Moderates and Independents in this country that we aren't ""far left"". We have a second chance, a second opportunity to get things right in 2008. John Kerry and John Edwards aren't in the White House because of National Security. Kerry's War Service, was not enough. So who do we have? Bob Kerry, out. Jack Reed, out. John Kerry, out. Then there's one of my hero's Jim Webb. Former Naval Secretary, Vietnam War Hero, and U.S. Marine. However, right now his best use is in the U.S. Senate where he was been working for us for the past 4 months. So that leaves us with the other hero of mine, General Wesley Clark. The former NATO Commander, highly decorated Vietnam Veteran, and a International Diplomat from his 34 year distinguished service in the U.S. Army.",0
"Title: It appeals to a broad spectrum: Kobach swears new job at Breitbart doesnt tie him to white supremacists  Article: Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (Photo: Screen capture) Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach is still leading President Donald Trumps so-called voter fraud commission, but hes also now working for his former senior aide. According to the Kansas City Star, Kobach has joined Breitbart News as a regular columnist. Kobach is also running for governor of Kansas and each of his articles link to his campaign website. Since June, Kobach has published stories about stopping undocumented immigrants from coming into the United States and blamed refugees for terrorism. I think Breitbart.com appeals to anyone who is Republican or conservative in any way, Kobach told The Star. He also disputed any claim that the site caters to white supremacists or Nazis. It appeals to a broad spectrum of conservative readers. Though four of the six stories attack immigrants, including a call for Trump to kill former President Barack Obamas agreement not to prosecute DREAMers. DACA is inconsistent with the rule of law, inconsistent with the presidents own promises, and inconsistent with the presidents principled stand against illegal immigration.",1
"Title: ISIS Leader Calls for American Muslim Voters to Support Hillary Clinton  Article: Top ISIS leader now believed to be the number two behind the terrorist organization, Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani, put up a video this week following the second presidential debate asking American Muslim voters to support Hillary Clinton. The controversial video that was taken down by YouTube only hours after it was uploaded showed top ISIS leader Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani threatening those who would decide to vote for Donald Trump and calling them infidels and goat f-ers.  All Muslims who will show support for the dog-faced Trump are guilty of masiya (mortal sin)   ISIS No.2 leader, Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani He also claimed that even if Hillary was a woman and a two face devil, had the charm of a pig and was treacherous as the snake, that the Democratic presidential hopeful was at least in league with the allied countries of the Islamic state such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Supporting the dog-faced Trump Al-alwani also warned all Muslims not to take his warnings lightly and that supporters of Trump would be severely punished on earth and in Jannah (afterlife). Trump is a dog, he is the scum of the earth. He boasts that he will take our oil and join Russia, Syria and the Shia Iranians against us in our holy fight he added, visibly angry. This (dog-faced) scumbag must not reach Washington. Although it is a sin to put an inferior being such as a woman into a position of power, it is the true plan of Satan to divide the Muslims of America.",1
"Title: Ex-UK PM on Obama: ""Narcissistic and Self-absorbed""  Article: Maybe some of those shrinks who suddenly got busy remotely psychoanalyzing Trump can spare a moment for their Beloved Leader? David Cameron thought Barack Obama was one of the 'most narcissistic, self-absorbed people' he had ever dealt with, his former strategy guru has claimed. Steve Hilton tore into Mr Obama for thinking he was 'smarter' than everyone else in the room and he claimed that his old boss Mr Cameron would get wound up by the ex President's self absorption. The former Downing Street adviser was highly critical of Mr Obama and said: 'My old boss, former British prime minister David Cameron, thought Obama was one of the most narcissistic, self-absorbed people he'd ever dealt with. 'Obama never listened to anyone, always thought he was smarter than every expert in the room, and treated every meeting as an opportunity to lecture everyone else. 'This led to real-world disasters, like Syria and the rise of Isis.' Cameron is denying this, inevitably. Obama still does have his cult of personality. But it's not hard to find examples of Obama boasting about his superiority to his own staff. And toward the end relations turned quite ugly as Obama tried to blame the UK for Syria. There hasn't been a single honest media assessment of the dysfunctional administration and its incoherent foreign policy. Instead we've been showered with vague adjectives about Obama's genius even as Iran burns. There's been no serious discussions about why Obama couldn't keep a Secretary of Defense, why the planning for ObamaCare was so poor and what happened in Syria. Instead we get flattery. The media is talking about running Oprah. But Obama was already Oprah.",0
"Title: The inevitability of socialism  Article: I say this, because at the core of my idea, is that this century will fly by, and I can't help but think that we will need to think like science fiction writers to face it's challenges. Devices that do our work for us are being invented every day...prefabrication cuts by two thirds the need for construction manpower...and modular is the wave of the future....oppotunities to shop and buy that are putting brick and mortar stores out of business. We're seeing the end of the newspaper industry. Factory farms that can feed huge populations and can be run by a handful of people. The list is long...the possibilities endless...and it means one thing. The need for human manpower could be cut by a large percentage....by the end of this century. So...what does that mean for our children's great grandchildren? They'll have incredible entertainment and information at their fingertips. They'll be well fed, well housed...driving vehicles that virtually prevent all accidents. But...they will have no jobs...no opportunities...no reason for living...EXCEPT to utilize. Computers will do all the paperwork. Machines will build all the products. So...what does that mean? If we don't decide...soon...that a socialized structure of living...of interaction...is inevitable...we are doomed to fail. With our time freed up...all of the citizens of the industrialized nations could help raise up the lives of all others. Not for profit....but simply because it's the right thing to do. Can this happen? Not without forsaking the hyper religious egomania of Christianity and Islam.",0
"Title: The Folks Who Gave us Rand Paul Think Chris Christie Won't Hold Up to Scrutiny %%  Article: The party that has offered us every kook who walks in off the street would really like to wish away New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

This is Mitt Romney, the same Mitt Romney who all by himself makes the egregiously corrupt Grant administration look like the most honest and above-board administration in American history. As author John Heilemann told Bill Maher Friday, Hes about to come under a level of scrutiny that, for all the attention hes gotten, hes never had before. Heilemann and Mark Halperin, who together co-write Game Change and now, Double Down, concluded that the Romney campaign considered and rejected Christie as a running mate in 2012: Mitt Romneys vettors looked into him really carefully  and they came away with a lot of questions about his background, questions he wouldnt answer. That kind of talk gets Republicans all excited.",0
"Title: Six Year Old Transgendered Girl Suffers From Hate Crime In School Restroom  Article: Six Year Old Transgendered Girl Suffers From Hate Crime In School Restroom By Investigative Reporter Derek Caldell At Grover Cleveland Elementary School in Oakton California, a transgendered girl was cruelly mocked and ridiculed for using the girls bathroom. Samuel Washington, a bright young African-American girl who prefers to go by Samantha, had the misfortune of being labelled male by doctors at birth. She is actually female, she states. Washington had been using the girls restroom at her school for two days before another student, Jessica Hernandez cruelly attacked her in the restroom stating Youre a boy, why are you in the girls bathroom? You arent supposed to be in here! Under the schools zero tolerance for hate crimes policy, the six year old Hernandez was expelled. It is disgusting that this kind of bigotry and ignorance persists in our community. Principal Sharon Johnson stated when we requested her comment on the matter. Tyrella Williamson of the local chapter of LGBT Americans United offered her insight on the tragedy. Somebody ought to kick that little transphobic bitchs ass. Obviously this hate is coming from her parents. She was taught to hate. No person is born a transphobic hate criminal Williamson stated. The facts of this case are not in dispute, but that hasnt stopped some extremists from attempting to use this case to promote hatred.",0
"Title: After Being Kicked Off Show, Trump Supporting Pastor Tells Joy Reid To Move To Haiti %%  Article: Shortly after MSNBCs Joy Reid laid an epic smackdown on Trump supporting pastor Mark Burns and eventually kicked him off the show, Burns fled to the safety of his Twitter page to attack the cable news host. In the video, the pastor told Reid that she should move to Haiti since shes more concerned about Haitian immigrants than black Americans here in poverty. The full video: #AMJoy should moved to #Haiti since she cares more for Haitians than Black Americans here in Poverty https://t.co/xtcBTqyKI5  Pastor Mark Burns (@pastormarkburns) January 13, 2018 A portion of Burnss post-interview comments: Just wanted to say to Joy, who I consider a friend, shes always been very kind and I think fair to me, but I think obviously in the interview you just saw, if you watched Joy Reid, that she should just move to Haiti since shes more concerned about Haitian immigrants than black Americans here in poverty, in America. IF youre so concerned about the Haitians then you should move to Haiti and donate your checks to those families who are in need in Haiti. The offensive attack on Reid by Burns comes after Reid called him out for using religion to defend both Trumps racist shithole comment and his policy position that the United States should send Haitians back to their country. If the country is so broken, then how can you as a man of God justify sending people back to that country? Reid asked during the interview. Burns didnt have an adequate response and the interview unraveled from there, with the MSNBC host eventually ending the interview by telling the pastor, Youre wasting my time.",0
"Title: Were Off to a Good Start!  Article: President Donald Trump described his much anticipated meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin as off to a good start, after meeting one-on-one with Putin for over two hours on Monday. Trump made his remarks to reporters before the start of a working lunch with Putin and his aides, which followed the two leaders private session. Before meeting with Putin, Trump said that the US and Russia will end up having an extraordinary relationship, despite current difficulties, adding I think the world wants to see us get along. Before his private discussion with Putin, Trump told reporters that he intended to discuss everything from trade to military to missiles to nuclear to China. Before the summit, Trump blamed previous administrations for the deterioration in relations between the US and Russia, tweeting: Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt! a reference to the ongoing and thus far unsuccessful Mueller investigation. The meeting took place amid opposition from both Democrats and Republicans at home. White House Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian hackers on Friday, and the news was expected to cast a cloud over the summit, despite the fact that the hackers alleged offences took place during the Obama administration.

"Title: The SPLC State...And The Unprecedented Threat To Civil Liberties | Articles  Article: Published in the Social Contract Journal, Spring 2018  The American Constitution utilizes checks and balances to prevent any one faction or person from controlling the State. Yet power over society is not exercised solely through government. Those who favor mass immigration and the abolition of American sovereignty project power from inside and outside the government simultaneously, leveraging law enforcement, the courts, financial institutions, and the media to their ends. And no single group does this better than the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), ostensibly a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) but increasingly becoming a kind of proto-government unto itself. The SPLC is so effective because it exercises power through multiple levels, each building on the other. Because of hate crimes legislation, the political ideology or affiliations of a criminal become highly relevant to any investigation. Though the FBI no longer lists the SPLC on its resources page, it continues to work with the organization to investigate hate crimes. It also trains local law enforcement in how to deal with extremists and hate groups. This begs the question of who constitutes these groups. This is where the SPLCs Intelligence Project comes in, which, as the name implies, serves as a kind of domestic intelligence agency. Political scientist George Michael noted the danger that this poses to civil liberties in Confronting Right-Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA:  The efforts of both NGOs and the government have done much to stymie the threat from the far right in America.... What are the implications of such cooperation between the government and NGOs in this area of public policy?",1

"Title: Spain Bucks the Happiness Trend  Article: By Delusional Economics, who is determined to cleanse the daily flow of vested interests propaganda to produce a balanced counterpoint. Cross posted from MacroBusiness. Market and real economic divergence continues apace in the European periphery and, much like Italy, Spain is again showing worrying signs that further fiscal tightening is creating far more severe negative consequences than expected. The deterioration in the economy is once again leading to a re-assessment of targets: European Union budget enforcer Olli Rehn signaled he might seek to ease Spains targets for cutting its budget deficit in a retreat from the demands that helped drive the economy into recession. EU officials will make a decision on the best pace for Spains budget consolidation when they deliver a scheduled assessment of the program in February, Rehn said at a press conference in Madrid yesterday. If there has been a serious deterioration in the economy, we can propose an extension of a countrys adjustment path, said Rehn, the EUs economic and monetary affairs commissioner, as he sat alongside Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos. Thats what we did last year in the case of Spain. But it isnt just the national government that is struggling under re-newed economic retrenchment. Regional governments are also in economic trouble and requesting life-lines from the state: The regional government of Catalonia on Tuesday formally requested 9 billion euros ($12 billion) from a rescue fund created by Spain to save its financially beleaguered regions.",0
"Title: Millionaire Poverty Pimps Fight 'Income Inequality'  Article: Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. Bernie Sanders, Michael Moore and Elizabeth Warren, three lefty millionaires, got together to solve ""income inequality"" in a town hall broadcast live from the Capitol visitors center. Washington D.C., where two out of the three parasites do business, has the worst income inequality in the country. The bottom fifth of Washington D.C. account for just 2% of the citys income. It has one of the highest poverty rates in the country and the highest food stamp use. And under Obama, the Imperial City of the politicians and the poor was surrounded by some of the wealthiest districts in the country. Income Inequality in America: The Rise of Oligarchy and Collapse of the Middle Class, the Sanders, Warren and Moore town hall, comes to progs from the most unequal and oligarchic city in America  If Bernie, Liz and Michael really want to see income inequality, they can take a walk away from the marble and glass edifices of big government to see what big government had wrought. It isnt any of their usual villains, the corporations and banks, who made Washington D.C. so miserable. Its the triumph of socialism. Washington D.C. and its bedroom communities are what the entire country would look like if the left got its way. A socialist apartheid state divided between the business of government and the poor. But the three socialist stooges arent just in the business of politics. Theyre millionaire poverty pimps. Bernie Sanders made over $1 million pushing conspiracy theories about income inequality.",1

"Title: Over 3 million sign petition to reinforce Romanias marriage law  Article: NewsMarriage May 16, 2017 (LifeSiteNews)  The people of Romania have spoken. In a country of approximately 20 million people, more than 3 million have signed a petition to enshrine in their constitution marriage between a man and a woman. In this way, the definition of marriage could be neither bent nor broken to accommodate homosexual partnerships, essentially banning same-sex ""marriages"" in the Christian country. The petition, a project of Romanias Coalition for Family, seeks to clarify the definition of marriage by stating the family is founded on the freely consented marriage between a man and a woman, their equality, and the right and duty of parents to ensure the upbringing, education, and instruction of children. The clarification is necessary because Romanias Constitution as it now stands speaks of marriage between spouses, written during an earlier period in history when spouses always implied marital relationships as between one man and one woman. To withstand current social and political forces that seek to exploit the now insufficiently descriptive language, an amendment to the constitution is required. The expressed will of the people is now in the hands of legislators. As of May 9, legislation is advancing.",1
"Title: A Good Leak  Article: Last weekend, the FBI arrested an employee of a corporation in Augusta, Georgia, that had a contract with the National Security Agency and charged her with espionage. Espionage occurs when someone who has been entrusted to safeguard state secrets fails to do so. In this case, the government alleges that the person to whom state secrets had been entrusted is 25-year-old Reality Leigh Winner, who had a top-secret national security clearance. The government claims that Winner downloaded and printed a top-secret NSA report, removed the printed version of the report from her employers premises, and then mailed it to The Intercept, a highly regarded international media outlet that exposes government wrongdoing. The government says it learned of this when folks from The Intercept called the NSA and told agents what they had received and what they planned to publish. After hearing agents describe the potential harm to their work if the full report were to be released, The Intercept agreed to redact certain portions, though it published the bulk of the report. Time to buy old US gold coins The report is startling, as it reveals that the NSA discovered that Russian hackers in late October and early November 2016 planted cookies (attractive, uniquely tailored links) into the websites of 122 American city and county clerks responsible for counting ballots in the The Constitution in Ex...

"Title: Argentina: 128-year-old man claims he is Adolf Hitler  Article: An elderly man from Salta in Argentina claims that hes the infamous German dictator Adolf Hitler and that he spent the last 70 years in hiding. In an interview with the ultra-conservative newspaper El Patriota, the naturalized German immigrant explains that he arrived in the country in 1945 with a passport identifying him Herman Guntherberg. He claims that his passport was a fake one produced by the Gestapo near the end of the war and that hes actually the former Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler. He says hes decided to come out of hiding after the Israeli secret services officially abandoned their policy of pursuing former Nazi war criminals last year. Ive been blamed for a lot of crimes that Ive never committed. Because of that, Ive had to spend more than half of my life hiding from Jews, so Ive had my punishment already. The elderly man claims hes preparing to publish his autobiography in order the restore his public image. Ive been depicted as a bad guy only because we lost the war. When people read my side of the story, it will change the way the perceive me. He says his book will be written under the name Adolf Hitler and should be available in September. Many people, including his wife of 55 years, Angela Martinez, believe that Herman Guntherberg isnt really Adolf Hitler, but is simply suffering from dementia. Ms. Martinez claims her husband never spoke about Hitler until approximately two years ago when he began showing signs of Alzheimers disease. Sometimes, he would forget who I was and where he was. He looked like he was in trance, and he would start talking about Jews and demons.",1

"Title: A woman can go to Heaven, as long as shes accompanied by a male relative claims Saudi Imam  Article: The conservative Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is slowly but surely opening to an increased role for women in society, as for the first time in the countrys history, an important religious leader has declared it possible for women to be admitted into Heaven. In a sermon he delivered at the Prophets Mosque in Medina last Friday, the progressive Imam Sheikh Salah Al-Budair declared that women can be admitted into heaven, as long as they are accompanied by Mahram relatives (male kin, who is not suitable for marriage under Islamic law). I know that I will shock many people by saying this, but I think that women can indeed be admitted into Heaven. , the Imam preached. The Prophet said No woman should travel except with a Mahram. Ascending to heaven is the greatest trip in every good muslims existence. I dont believe that the Prophet meant this trip to be an exception. I think that a woman can get into Heaven, as long as shes accompanied by a man of her family. This, of course, implies that at least one man in her family needs to be admitted himself This surprising declaration is in complete rupture with the countrys traditional hard line, which states that woman can never be admitted into Heaven, under any circumstances. A group of conservative scholars and religious leaders from across Saudi Arabia, overseen by the countrys ministry of Islamic Affairs, signed a declaration condemning the Imams sermon as a blasphemy, and reaffirming that only men are worthy of going to Heaven. Its our responsibility to spread the true word of God, and all irresponsible people like Sheikh al-Budair are tarnishing Islam are contrary to the teachings of the Quran and the Hadith.",0
"Title: Opinion: Tough On Crime Sessions Has No U.S. Attorneys To Prosecute Federal Crimes %%  Article: There are a lot of things Americans have learned about the Trump administration in just a couple of months. For the most part, Americans have learned that the Trump crew are liars, incompetent twits, corrupt, and they talk big and promise results. But they dont, havent and cant deliver; likely because they are liars, corrupt, talk big and most of all they are incompetent know-nothing imbeciles. Over the past week, lying Attorney General Jeff Sessions has promised to get tough on crime and prioritize what he claims is going to be aggressive law enforcement. He issued orders to federal prosecutors nationwide to really bear down on undocumented immigrants and use all the tools at their disposal to pursue violent criminals and drug traffickers. This is big talk from an incompetent attorney general who has zero U.S attorneys to lead the Trump-Sessions get tough on crime campaign. Right now there are 93 vacant U.S. attorney positions including the 46 that Sessions asked to resign and the 47 who had already bailed instead of work for a corrupt madman. It is unclear why none have been replaced, but it could be because Sessions is too engrossed in attending weekly bible study and prayer meetings or criticizing a Federal Judge on some Pacific island for ruling according to the U.S. Constitution against the Trump . Last week when Session convened a meeting with federal law enforcement officials, he was asked about the lack of federal prosecutors that would be necessary to really get tough on crime. He said We really need to work hard on that.",1

This journalist had the privilege of interviewing Mr. Marshall by phone last week. A transcript of that interview follows below. Ivan Fernando: I want to thank you for agreeing to this interview. I understand that your store has been under fire recently for your new policy of allowing poor African-American urban youths to take merchandise, regardless of their ability or willingness to pay for it. If I understand further, they are also allowed to destroy property, in order to vent their rage over racism and economic inequality? Can you tell me a little bit about that policy and how it came about? Stan Marshall: Thank you for contacting me! It is a pleasure to talk to you today. Recent events have proven that the overwhelming majority of police officers are violent white racists. Suppose a young man of color comes into my store, and takes something. Is it ok to call a bunch of racists, who will likely beat him within an inch of his life or even kill him because of his skin color? I say no! In fact, why punish him at all? We need to level the playing field so that everyone has the same amount of money and property! I am a proud social justice warrior! I believe in giving back to the community!

"Title: Rush: Media, Democratic Party destroyed today  Article: The verdict is in, following the special election for Georgias 6th congressional district seat, and President Donald Trump has won. Not the seat, but in the politics. And its much more than that, according to talk-radio behemoth Rush Limbaugh. You have no idea the degree to which the media and the Democratic Party are destroyed today. Im talking about how they feel  which is complete and utter defeat, frustration and devastation, and they have no answers, he said Wednesday, hours after Republican Karen Handel was a multiple percentage point winner over defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff. The dirty little secret is the media and the Democratic Party is turning off average Americans. They are not persuading, they are not convincing people Trump is a reprobate, he continued. They do not know how to beat Donald Trump. They are depressed and despondent. It is funereal. The look on their faces. Utter despondency, he said. Theyre empty. They literally have nothing that is new or relevant to our times. Theyre so far out of the zeitgeist, theyve got nothing to do but chase this mythical Russians stole the election from them. That Hillary should be in the White House. That they should be controlling the House. And this why the people that vote for them are so despondent and now engaging in continuing unbalanced, insane behavior. The Georgia election was to fill the seat vacated by Tom Price, who was named the presidents health and human services secretary. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich cut immediately to the bottom line, writing at FoxNews.com: For the left this race had been portrayed as a referendum on Trump.

"Title: Never, Ever Threaten the United States Again: President Trump Warns Iranian President To Stop Threats Or Suffer Historic Consequences  Article: I love this man. President Trump has responded to the recent threat made by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani during his address to a gathering of Iranian diplomats. The Iran news agency ISNA reports. He said:  Irans power is deterrent and we have no fight or war with anybody but the enemies must understand well that war with Iran is the mother of all wars and peace with Iran is the mother of all peace. We have never been intimidated and will respond threat with threat. Today, speaking with US has no meaning except surrender and end of peoples achievements. Mr. Trump! We are the people of dignity and guarantor of security of the waterway of the region throughout the history. Dont play with the lions tail; you will regret it.

Article: But Franciss handpicked coordinator of the Council, Cardinal Oscar ( Mad Dog ) Rodrguez Maradiaga of Honduras, has just been exposed as a financial huckster thriving on the backs of the poor about which he pontificates constantly in the usual manner of a Latin American leftist ideologue. Is anyone surprised? Before discussing the details of the scandal and its significance for the Church at large, a few words about the Cardinals background are in order. Like every other propaganda theme concocted by the Vatican apparatus since Vatican II, including the conciliar springtime, dialogue with the world, the liturgical renewal, the ecumenical venture and the New Evangelization, the theme of Francis the Great Reformer is a hoax that conceals an underlying, ever-worsening state of ecclesial dissolution whose scope is without precedent in Church history.

"Title: Elderly woman accused of training her 65 cats to steal from neighbors  Article: Columbus, Ohio | An 83-year old woman was arrested this morning and accused of training dozens of cats to steal jewelry and other valuables from her neighbors. The Columbus Police Department opened an investigation on Ruth Gregson and her 65 cats in October after several neighbors reported small objects being stolen from their homes. Several victims reported being visited by Ms. Gregsons cats before noticing the disappearance of several shiny objects, like valuable cutlery and pieces of jewelry. Despite their skepticism, investigators began a surveillance operation and were amazed by what they discovered. According to Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs, dozens of cats were constantly coming and going, bringing home anything that shined. She was like Fagin in Oliver Twist, but she was using cats as thieves instead of children. In less than three hours of surveillance, the detectives saw the cats bring home more than a hundred objects. Upon searching Ms. Gregsons house, investigators found $650,000 worth of jewelry and precious metal among piles of worthless shiny baubles. A total of 65 adult cats and 17 kittens were found on the site and entrusted to the Columbus Humane Society. Chief Jacobs says the elderly woman confessed to training her cats to steal, saying the felines had to earn their meals. She would only feed the animals if they brought home valuables, so the animals had to steal every day in order to survive.",0
"Title: Comrade Merkels Suicidal Bullying  Article: For many years German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been regarded, with reason, as the most powerful woman in the world. Over the past few months, Merkels authority has diminished precipitously, however, mainly due to her irrational immigration policy. That much became obvious at last weekends emergency EU summit on immigration. The meeting was hastily convened at Merkels insistence to develop a joint European strategy to deal with the ongoing migrant onslaught. In reality, it was meant to be Operation Save Mutti: a means of preventing her governments collapse by showing that the Union can develop a tougher immigration strategy. Her goal was to ease the pressure from the Christian Social Union (CSU)her Christian Democratic Partys (CDU) Bavarian partnerwhich had threatened to leave her ruling coalition unless she agreed to end her open door policy. CSU leader Horst Seehofer had threatened to resign as Germanys interior minister unless Merkel agreed to refuse entry to migrants who had applied for asylum elsewhere in the EU, potentially forcing an early election at which the Alternative for Germany (AfD) would be likely to increase its share of the vote. This is not about whether Frau Merkel stays as Chancellor next week or not, Xavier Bettel, Luxembourgs Prime Minister, announced as he came out of the meeting in Brussels. Unwittingly (or perhaps mendaciously), he let the cat out of the bag. Indeed, the summits true objective was to appease Merkels domestic detractorsbut the task proved to be beyond her.",0
"Title: Sober scriptural wisdom on avoiding the whirlwind of lust  Article: OpinionCatholic Church, Faith, Pornography January 27, 2015 (ADW.org) - There is a marvelous chapter in the Book of Proverbs that ought to be studied by every young person who must live in this lustful world. Its sets forth plainly the stance that any son or daughter of God should have regarding the lust so often celebrated by this age. Many preachers and teachers wince at the Book of Proverbs on this topic since it tends to portray seduction and lust as coming from women. However it must be recalled that Proverbs features a father speaking to his son. So the context is that of a young man experiencing seduction from a certain class of women (not all women). The silence of this chapter of Proverbs on the problem of men seducing women should not be taken as a denial of this problem; it is simply not the context of the discussion. Any woman ought to be able to take the advice given here and translate it for her own sake as well. With that in mind lets look at this masterful advice from the Wisdom of God. The alliterations (on the letter D) are based on a talk by Rev. Adrian Rogers that I heard many years ago. While the alliterations are his, the content of this article is wholly mine. I. The Discretion we should follow - 1 My son, be attentive to my wisdom, incline your ear to my understanding; 2 that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge. As we have seen, the Book of Proverbs takes up the form of a father advising his son. One of the most critical roles a father or parent has is to teach and hand on the preserved and tested wisdom that comes to us from God and from experience.",0

They put illegal aliens ahead of paychecks for our soldiers. Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Cant let that happen!

"Title: Clinton Researcher Commits Suicide Before Releasing Info on Crime Couple  Article: Longtime Republican political operative and private equity industry manager from the Chicago area Peter W. Smith was found dead of alleged suicide 10 days after being interviewed by mainstream media about his investigation of Hillary and Bill Clinton. Sadly, information that would confirm or deny his suicide is not being released by the Chicago police or the coroner. Will Smith become simply one more open-ended mystery in the long string of individuals whove died under questionable circumstances after publicly revealing Clinton wrong-doing? By Mark Anderson Considering the sordid history of political intrigue and foul play surrounding Hillary and Bill Clinton, the rather mysterious death in Rochester, Minn. of a longtime investigator of the Clintons isnt generating anything close to the level of public interest it deserves. Whats worse is that national TV-media outlets evidently are blacking out news about investigator Peter W. Smiths suicide and how and why he died in mid-May. This broadcast-news suppression is even harder to explain considering several sizable newspapers and social media have to some extent covered Smiths apparent suicide. Yet, the national TV networks did not run with the story, even as they obsess nonstop over flimsy Trump-Russia collusion allegations. The Wall Street Journal, to its credit, took the lead in publishing reports on Smiths research on Hillary, having interviewed Smith just 10 days before he was found dead. Smith is reported to have left a suicide note, stating that he took his own life at age 81 due to ill health.",1

Now new evidence is revealing that top Obama Administration officials coordinated with each other and the FBI to help CNN run a damaging and unverified story on Trump and the infamous salacious dossier. The mainstream media wont touch this story with a ten-foot-pole because it not only shows the unsurprising amounts of actual lies and fake news they put out daily, but it also details how CNN was used to run damaging stories at the behest of the Obama administration. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs released new emails on Monday night that allegedly show that Obama administration officials coordinated with each other to help CNN run a damaging story on President-elect Donald Trump based on salacious and unverified information contained in a politically motivated dossier financed by Trumps political enemies (Hillary Clinton and the DNC.)

"Title: Did a Muslim Screaming Allahu Akbar Disrupt the Pentecost Mass in a French Cathedral?  Article: According to a French-language report in Riposte catholique, it happened on May 20, Pentecost Sunday for Roman Catholics, in Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes, France: a Muslim grabbed the microphone during the sermon by Bishop Jean-Paul James and screamed Allahu akbar. However, in yet another example of dhimmitude and willful ignorance from a Catholic bishop, Catholic officials deny that the intruder said Allahu akbar at all. Presse Ocan reported:  It took only one publication that was wrong, so that the rumor remains on the web: a man tore the microphone out of the hands of the bishop of Nantes on Sunday, in the middle of the solemn Mass of Pentecost, to shout Allahu akbar in the cathedral packed to the rafters. Relayed several hundred times over the Internet, what is then presented as an info from a very reliable source has begun to fuel fantasies. However, it cannot stand up to the objectivity of the facts. Father Benot Bertrand, Vicar General of the Diocese of Nantes, was on the right of Bishop Jean-Paul James when a man was on the podium. It was about 10:30 am, and the bishop began his homily in front of 1,500 to 2,000 people [] The man grabbed the microphone and made remarks in a foreign language. He did not shout Allahu akbar at all, says the vicar. Clinging to the microphone, he was determined to speak and seemed especially extremely fragile psychologically [] There are always malicious people who seek to fuel this kind of rumor and excite peoples minds when they should rather seek to calm them. It is not a matter of being naive, we remain vigilant in the national context, but everyone must stick to the reality and the objectivity of the facts.",1
"Title: Nigerian Pedophile Denaturalized And DeportedMSM: Sex Offender From Grand Prairie"" | Blog Posts  Article: The Dallas News headline is In a move once reserved for Nazis, sex offender from Grand Prairie loses citizenship and gets deported. But he cant be from Grand Prairie, if hes being deported, he has to be from somewhere else, that theyre deporting him to. It turns out that the answer to what inquiring minds want to know is he's a Nigerian pedophile, something that could easily go in the headline. Emmanuel Olugbenga Omopariola, 61, was convicted of indecency with a 7-year-old girl, an offense committed before he was naturalized, according to federal officials and federal court papers. He was deported back to Nigeria on Thursday, under escort from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. This deportation ends this U.S. chapter for Omopariola who sabotaged his own future and opportunities through his heinous crimes against a child, and his lies on his naturalization application and in interviews, said Simona L. Flores, field office director for removal operations for ICE in the Dallas region. The point about ""a move once reserved for Nazis"" is that the US government pursued a policy of denaturalizing anyone who could be shown to have lied on his immigration papers. Ann Coulter, discussing the number of undeported radical Muslims, et cetera wrote last year that  To this day, we have a whole office at the Department of Justice dedicated to finding and deporting Nazis even without proof they personally committed crimes against Jews. But they could only do this because the Government always asks new citizens to swear that they weren't Nazis before naturalizing them.",1

He begins with the story of his great-uncle, Lance Corporal John McDonald. His great-uncle was born in a small Scottish village. Along with his friend, Charles Beveridge, McDonald enlisted with the 8th Scottish Rifles (the Cameronians) when war broke out. They said farewell to friends and family on 17 May 1915, headed to the eastern Mediterranean. They arrived at the Greek island of Lemnos, the staging post for British and Allied forces, on 29 May  one month after the fighting on Gallipoli had broken out.

Trump offered this assessment of his hand-picked attorney general recusing himself from the Justice Departments special counsel probe of Russian election meddling: What kind of man is this? Trump, in an interview that aired Thursday morning, also blasted Sessions because, he said, the former Alabama senator never took control of the Justice Department.

And, by doing so, took on Trump publicly in a way few Republicans in Washington have during his turbulent 19-month-old presidency.

"Title: In Unanimous Decision SCOTUS Rules Police Must Get A Warrant to Search Cell Phone Data %%  Article: In a unanimous ruling the Supreme Court decided, The police generally may not, without a warrant, search digital information on a cell phone seized from an individual who has been arrested. The case of Riley v. California is a consolidated case. For the Plaintiff David Leon Riley, this case began when he was stopped for a traffic violation that eventually led to weapons charges. While searching Riley, a police officer seized Rileys cell phone. Riley was faced charges related to a shooting that occurred weeks earlier based on photos and video the police officer found on his phone. The trial court denied Rileys motion to suppress the evidence obtained from his phone and he was convicted. The trial courts ruling on the motion to suppress was affirmed by The California court of Appeals. This case began for Brima Wurie when he was arrested in Boston for participating in a drug sale. The police seized his phone after they arrived at the police station. Thats when they noticed the phone was receiving several calls from a source my house. Police officers traced that phone number to what they suspected was Wuries apartment. That is when the police got a search warrant that lead to their discovery of drugs, a firearm and ammunition. As a result, Wurie faced drug and firearms charges. Like Riley, Wurie filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained because of the search warrant.",0

"Title: Once Again Our Islamist President Uses His Authority to Cut Military Pay  Article: Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE Obama has for the second year in row used his executive powers to put a cap on pay raises for our loyal armed forces Once Again Our Islamist President Uses His Authority to Cut Military Pay Its just not right for the President of the United States to be a lap dog for any foreign entity and even more so if that favored group is a terrorist inclined quasi religious gathering of foreigners who are anti-American at heart. This current occupant of our Oval Office fits that description totally. Obama has for the second year in row used his executive powers to put a cap on pay raises for our loyal armed forces and is repeating the mistakes of past administrations that were intent on degrading and insulting to our military by not allowing legitimate pay increases. According to a letter from the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) dated September 5, 2014 an active duty pay raise is determined by private sector wage growth, measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI calls for a 1.8 percent pay raise in 2015. According to the MOAA letter, From 2000 to 2012, Congress worked hard to eliminate a 13.5 percent military pay gap with the private sector caused by repeatedly capping military raises in the 1980s and 90s. But the restoration of military pay comparability with the private sector is under threat.

"Title: Trump to visit border wall prototypes in March  Article: WASHINGTON  President Donald Trump will travel to California next month on a cross-country trek that will include a visit to eight prototypes for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, a White House official confirmed Tuesday. The Washington Post first reported the news. The Trump administration has formally asked Congress for $18 billion in wall funding. The presidents immigration overhaul framework proposed a trust fund totaling $25 billion that would include the wall construction monies and be allotted in one lump sum  but as part of a broader immigration deal that has so far eluded lawmakers and the White House. With the Supreme Court on Monday opting against expediting a legal case about Trumps order to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that shields nearly 700,000 undocumented people from deportation, a March 5 deadline to pass a DACA-addressing immigration bill is now moot. That means Trumps proposed border wall project also now is in limbo  which puts fulfilling a major campaign pledge to his base in doubt as the midterm election season heats up. In his signature fashion, Trump on Friday told a conservative audience not to worry about whether he ultimately will get the border barrier built. Dont worry, youre getting the wall, he said at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington. Dont worry, OK? Were getting the wall. The audience, which he at time whipped into a frenzy during his wildly meandering remarks, responded with a chant that helped define his 2016 campaign: Build that wall! Build that wall!

Personal Liberty Digest presents: The WIRE! Led by The Boston Globe, over 300 newspapers turned their editorial pages into screeds about how Trump is threatening the free and independent press. Because nothing says free and independent like 300 people saying the same thing. Democrats got their panties in a bunch over the upcoming confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Many, still smarting over the Merrick Garland debacle, are calling Kavanaugh, and even the Court itself, illegitimate. Welp, elections have consequences, kids. According to Nana Hilldawg, refusing to accept election results is horrifying. Disgraced FBI agent Peter Strzok is now disgraced EX-FBI agent Peter Strzok. But dont worry about Petey, he has already managed to raise nearly $500,000 through a GoFundMe drive. The border wall is wasteful, but liberals coughed up a half million of their own cash because Strzok got his ass fired? Between this and the inevitable bidding war between CNN and MSNBC for Strzoks services, hes gonna be fine, just fine. Strzoks digital begging was enhanced by the GoFundMe pages assertion that hes a proud husband. Gonna go out on a limb and suggest Mrs. Strzok didnt proof the copy beforehand. At least now Lisa Page wont have to worry about whos paying for dinner. Only a couple dozen right-wing types showed up for the Unite The Right 2 march. Fortunately, the Antifa thugs are there in droves, so violent, stupid, fascism was well-represented.",0
