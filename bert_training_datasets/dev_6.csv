"Title: Treason, #Arkancide bloat the Clinton fortune, invalidate presidential bid  Article: Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE Quit complaining and vote Treason, #Arkancide bloat the Clinton fortune, invalidate presidential bid Inflammatory headline? Perhaps. At least until the facts are considered on their merits and not on the general medias sugarcoating. One of the greatest hurdles American voters are confronting is media avoiding the landmines of the democrat nominees fringe criminality and outright lawbreaking by focusing attention on the myth of a strong Obama economy and Hillary Clintons support of these policies. Its time to drop the pretense that democrats work to make life better for the less fortunate. The opposite has been borne out by decades of failed assistance programsfrom the Great Society (re-invented New Deal), to expanding tentacles into public education, welfare, housing, environment, healthcare (Affordable Care Act) and infrastructure (Stimulus), ad infinitumthat have plunged cities into virtual prisons of poverty. Refuting the words of hope and change is the dismal truth of back-slapping power brokering that has made politicians like the Clintons and Obamas enormously wealthy for doing not only nothing, but reversing the growth potential of average citizens by tying their hands with miles of regulating red tape. Under other circumstances, the Clintons and Obamas would be cardinal examples of how someone can rise from mediocre beginnings to find success in the world. (Mediocre is purposefully used rather than the expected modest.) Consider how the Clintons climbed the political ladder by latching onto elitist racist socialists during their college years.",1
"Title: Supreme Court Makes Unanimous Ruling Against The Trump Administration (DETAILS)  Article: Before the Trump administration finally found itself able to claim a significant legislative victory because of the tax reform plan in late 2017, the president marked his time in office by presiding over the shredding of as much pre-existing regulation as possible, no matter the cost. One of the regulations up for the chopping block was the Waters of the United States rule, an Obama era move that formally extended the governments authority to curtail pollution to small waterways. The original move proved controversial among industry interests because of the cost of complying with the regulations. In the aftermath of the rules implementation, interests in the matter brought dozens of lawsuits against the government, and in one of them, the Supreme Court has just unanimously ruled against the government  in other words, against the Trump administration. The ruling is not on the merits of the rule itself, but rather on the proper court for hearing challenges to the rule in question. The Trump administration has asserted that courts of appeals are the proper venue for such challenges, while industry interests have insisted that district courts are the proper venue.",0
"Title: BLM Whistleblower Believes BLM Was In Violation Of Law Regarding Its Law Enforcement Authority at Bundy Ranch  Article: BLM Whistleblower Believes BLM Was In Violation Of Law Regarding Its Law Enforcement Authority at Bundy Ranch  Please help support us with cryptocurrency donations. Thank you! Washington State Representative Matt Shea spoke about the sealed hearings going on in Nevada concerning the Bundy Ranch trials last week, including a kill list, and hes back with an update in which a Bureau of Land Management agent is attempting to provide propaganda in an attempt to discredit former FLM agent Larry Wooten, who blew the whistle on the corruption, unprofessionalism and quite possibly, criminal activities of agents within the BLM. However, in revealing that information, it was also revealed that Agent Wooten believed the BLM was in violation of the law regarding its law enforcement authority. In the latest documents, BLM Agent Kent Klemen, who is a government witness in this case, makes an attempt to discredit Mr. Wootens claims. Keep that in mind, as Klemens first words are that the BLM was requested to remove Mr. Wooten from the Bundy Ranch investigation at the request of prosecutor Steven Myhre. And why did Myhre want Wooten removed? According to Klemen, Wooten had made recent statements that Wooten believes the BLM lacks law enforcement authority. Looks like someone was waking up in the Matrix . The request by Myhre came on February 17 of this year, and it was implemented on the 18th, just one day later, according to Klemen. Take a look as Rep. Shea explains what is extremely important information in the Bundy Ranch case.",0
"Title: This Ancient Babylonian Star Map Of Jupiter Just Changed History  Article: A researcher has just deciphered a mysterious clay tablet from ancient Babylon and it has changed history forever. After close study, researchers concluded that ancient Babylonian Astronomers were able to calculate the precise celestial movements of Jupiter with the help of an ancient form of geometric calculus, which, according to mainstream scholars, wasnt invented over millennia after. Mainstream scholars had maintained for quite some time now that this type of math was by the Europeans over 1500 years later. The ancient Babylonian tablet was translated by Astro archaeologist Matthieu Ossendrijver of Humbolt University in Berlin. As Science Alert reports: This means that these ancient Mesopotamian astronomers had not only figured out how to predict Jupiters paths more than 1,000 years before the first telescopes existed, but they were using mathematical techniques that would form the foundations of modern calculus as we now know it. The discovery is a groundbreaking one, since the tablet belongs to a group of hundreds of other tablets that were excavated during the 19th century, and researchers all around the globe have been working for over one hundred ears, trying to decode them all. Researchers believe that the clay tablets date back to around 100 or 200 BC. The tablets are the ultimate piece of evidence which suggests that ancient astronomers had the knowledge and ability to calculate both speed and distance of celestial objects. The tablet proves that ancient Babylonian astronomers were tracing Jupiter in the sky in a specific amount of time.",0
"Title: Opinion: Tough On Crime Sessions Has No U.S. Attorneys To Prosecute Federal Crimes %%  Article: There are a lot of things Americans have learned about the Trump administration in just a couple of months. For the most part, Americans have learned that the Trump crew are liars, incompetent twits, corrupt, and they talk big and promise results. But they dont, havent and cant deliver; likely because they are liars, corrupt, talk big and most of all they are incompetent know-nothing imbeciles. Over the past week, lying Attorney General Jeff Sessions has promised to get tough on crime and prioritize what he claims is going to be aggressive law enforcement. He issued orders to federal prosecutors nationwide to really bear down on undocumented immigrants and use all the tools at their disposal to pursue violent criminals and drug traffickers. This is big talk from an incompetent attorney general who has zero U.S attorneys to lead the Trump-Sessions get tough on crime campaign. Right now there are 93 vacant U.S. attorney positions including the 46 that Sessions asked to resign and the 47 who had already bailed instead of work for a corrupt madman. It is unclear why none have been replaced, but it could be because Sessions is too engrossed in attending weekly bible study and prayer meetings or criticizing a Federal Judge on some Pacific island for ruling according to the U.S. Constitution against the Trump . Last week when Session convened a meeting with federal law enforcement officials, he was asked about the lack of federal prosecutors that would be necessary to really get tough on crime. He said We really need to work hard on that.",1

"Title: Polish Parliament to vote this week on new bill to ban abortion  Article: NewsAbortion WARSAW, Poland, January 10, 2017 (LifeSiteNews)  Polish pro-lifers are trying again to force a vote in Parliament to establish an abortion ban, with legislators facing an initial vote on a new bill January 12. In October, the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) killed a bill to ban abortion proposed by the Stop Abortion Committee. The bill was the work of a grassroots movement and, contrary to foreign press reports, was started neither by the Catholic Church nor by the government. The Polish democratic system enables a group of citizens to initiate legislation in the lower chamber of the Parliament, called the Sejm, by gathering 100,000 signatures. The citizens initiative on abortion received more than 450,000 signatures. Several organizations were behind the bill, including the Ordo Iuris Institute for Legal Culture and The Right to Life Foundation. The proposed law left punishing women who committed abortions to the discretion of judges, a provision rejected by some pro-life organizations. In response, the Polish Federation of Pro-Life Movements created a similar bill without legal responsibility for women, giving the pro-lifers a chance to ban abortions. Their bill was presented to the lower house of the Parliament in September 2016. The Polish Federation of Pro-Life Movements drafted it and sent it to the Sejms Commission on Petitions. The Ordo Iuris and The Right to Life Foundation recently supported their actions, and the bill will be voted on January 12. The failure of the Sejm to ban abortion in 2016 means that the 1993 law is still in place.",0
"Title: American Border Patrol Feature  Article: Newsweek -- November 25, 2017 CAN THIS LATINO LAWMAKER HELP STOP TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE? Antonio Villaraigosa has a shot at becoming California's first Latino governor since 1875. But he doesn't want to hear that. I'm an American, not only a Latino, Villaraigosa said in a recent interview with Newsweek. I love this country. With the election still a year away, Villaraigosa, who appeared on the cover of Newsweek after becoming Los Angeles' first Latino mayor in 2005, already faces a long road to Sacramento. His chief opponent, former mayor of San Francisco and current Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, a so-called golden boy of California politics, is out-polling and out-fundraising him. ....Last month, his campaign released a 12-minute video created by Mark Putnam, the director behind one of Barack Obama's famous 30-minute campaign video during the 2008 presidential election. In the video, Villaraigosa celebrates his working-class and Latino background while blasting the Trump administration's onslaught of anti-immigration policies. Glenn Spencer -- December 23, 2017 Can President Trump Save California? Antonio Villaraigosa stands a good chance of being elected governor of California. If that happens, America stands a good chance of losing California. From 1992 to 2002, I ran a California group, Voice of Citizens Together, that fought against illegal immigration.",0
"Title: Family Security Matters  Article: Debunking the Biggest Immigration Lies October 2, 2016 John Adams famously stated, ""Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence. "" Knowledge is power. Nations go to great lengths to steal the secrets of their enemies for a variety of purposes. Conversely, nations seek to protect their own secrets jealously and often provide false information, known as ""disinformation,"" to confuse and confound their enemies. A historic example of such disinformation was a military operation launched by the Allies during the Second World War known as ""Operation Fortitude"" also known as the ""Calais Deception,"" wherein the Nazis were convinced that the Allies would launch an attack as Pas de Calais when in reality, U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, was planning to attack German forces at Normandy to begin the liberation of France. The invasion at Normandy was given the code-name, ""Operation Overlord"" but history remembers it as ""D-Day. "" General Eisenhower and his colleagues were concerned that if all of the German forces were assembled in Normandy that Operation Overlord would fail. Consequently General George S. Patton created an illusory ""invasion force"" consisting largely of inflatable vehicles that, from the air, appeared to Nazi pilots to be an actual invasion force. It was aptly described as ""Patton's Ghost Army.",0
"Title: More Muslim Faked Hate: 11-Year-Old Muslima Lied About About Being Attacked For Wearing Hijab  Article: Another worldwide brouhaha over a Muslim hate crime and then the subsequent media after it is exposed as a faked incident by a Muslim. The majority of hate crimes against Muslims are committed or faked by Muslims in order to give some evidence of the big lie of Islamophobia. UPDATE: Reported attack 'did not happen': Police say UPDATE: Police now say the reported attack on an 11-year-old girl wearing a hijab ""described in the original news release did not happen."" Full details: www.cbc.ca/1.4487716 Posted by CBC Toronto on Friday, January 12, 2018  Before this hate crime was even vetted, the increasingly unfit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau exploited it to further the imposition of sharia in Canada. He has yet to make a comment. Attacks on Jews are double the attacks on Muslims in Canada, and Trudeau never said a word. An assailant, in two attempts within 10 minutes, cut the girls hijab using scissors while she was walking to school with her brother on Friday, a Toronto police spokeswoman said. I felt confused, scared, terrified, Khawlah Noman, who is in Grade 6, told reporters at her school on Friday. I screamed. The man just ran away. We followed this crowd of people to be safe. He came again. He continued cutting my hijab again. What a vicious liar. These lies and smears against non-Muslims are encouraged by a media and political elite that richly rewards such claims. Reporting a hate crime that is faked should be a criminal offense. How many people were harassed and interrogated by the police as a result of this hate crime?",1
"Title: Muslim Candidate for Governor Comes Unhinged Over Sharia  Article: Michigan's first-ever Muslim candidate for governor, Dr. Abdul al-Sayed, took a shot at fellow gubernatorial candidate Patrick Colbeck on Thursday that some Republicans are saying was below the belt. Colbeck, speaking at a candidate's forum in East Lansing, expressed his concerns about Sharia law and the extremist Muslim Brotherhood's tactic of civilization jihad. Colbeck took exception with an article he says was planted last month by Sayed supporters at the left-wing website Buzzfeed, which painted Colbeck as a fringe extremist using ""unfounded conspiracy theories"" against Sayed. Rather than address Colbeck's concerns about the Brotherhood, Sayed called Colbeck a racist Islamophobe whom Muslims ""definitely hate."" Sayed, 33, the former public-health director for the city of Detroit, was on stage Thursday evening at the Michigan Press Association with several other Democrat and Republican candidates for governor running in the Aug. 7 primary. Sayed refused to answer a question from the moderator about the Islamic legal system known as Sharia, other than to say that, if elected, he would uphold the constitutions of the U.S. and State of Michigan. ""I take [the Constitution] particularly seriously because it guarantees me two things. A, the right to pray as I choose to pray, and for me that means I put my face on the ground 34 times a day,"" Sayed said. ""Some people choose not to pray at all. Then in Article Six it also tells us that no religious test should be held over someone wishing to serve under this Constitution. It's an incredible document.""",1

Sputnik/ Vladimir Astapkovich Russia to Review Gas Discount for Ukraine Every Quarter - Energy Minister BRUSSELS (Sputnik)  The European Commission will also continue to provide [Ukraines] ongoing funding in the winter period because for its safe passage, as you know, Ukraine not only needs to store gas, but purchase current volumes to meet its domestic needs, Novak said.

"Title: Egyptian government steps down - media  Article: Egyptian government steps down - media Egypt's governments has stepped down, online version of Al-Ahram newspaper reported on Monday. The publication added that the decision was taken after a 15-minute session of the Cabinet. Egypt's military-backed government has quit, state-run Al Ahram said on Monday in a report confirmed by an Egyptian official, a step likely to pave the way for army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to declare his candidacy for president. The newspaper, citing an unnamed source in a report on its website, said the decision was made after a 15-minute cabinet meeting. For Sisi to run for president, he would first need to leave his post of defence minister. ""This was done as a step that was needed ahead of Sisi's announcement that he will run for president,"" an Egyptian official said. Sisi unveiled a political roadmap meant to lead to elections after toppling Islamist President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood in July following mass protests against his rule. Morsi's removal triggered the bloodiest political crisis in Egypt's modern history, with security forces killing hundreds of his supporters and jailing thousands. Hundreds of security personnel have also died in the turmoil. Egyptian Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi said on Monday the government is to resign. ""Today the cabinet took a decision to offer its resignation to the president of the republic,"" Beblawi said in a televised statement.",0
"Title: MSNBC's Chris Matthews Obliterates Paranoid Trump, Calls Him A ""Weirdo In The Basement"" %%  Article: MSNBCs Chris Matthews pulled no punches on Thursday, slamming Donald Trump for his repeated lies and offering harsh words for those who bend over backward to defend the president when he does or says something flatly untrue. Matthews said, The man in the White House is demonstrably capable of making up claims that have no reality. Video: Matthews said: Tomorrows Friday. If the president were to rise at dawn and say, Its Saturday, what would be the meaning of that statement? Would his people  those who back him no matter what  check their calendars and convince themselves the calendar theyve been using is wrong and the leader they adore is right? This whole thing about President Obama wiretapping Trump is nothing but trumped up nonsense  The man in the White House is demonstrably capable of making up claims that have no reality. Hes no better than the weirdo in the basement who calls in the fire alarm just to hear the sirens go past. The MSNBC host isnt right about everything, but on this, he is spot on. Not only is Trumps latest claim about President Obama ludicrous, but its just the latest in his long history of perpetuating complete falsehoods. Worse is that those who work for him in the White House and the Americans who support him will defend him at all costs. Trumps claims about Barack Obama are no different than him waking up tomorrow and claiming its not Friday, but instead its whatever day he chooses it to be. Up is down, left is right, Fox News is fair and balanced. To the new administration, reality is no longer a concrete, indisputable thing  its whatever Trump says it is.",0

By Michael Collins Piper An inquiry into the background of flamboyant American entrepreneur Donald J. Trump provides some surprising insights into Trumps path to power and influence, for the fact is that Trumps rise to stardom came as a direct consequence of his having functioned as hardly more than a colorful front man for some very wealthy behind-the-scenes sponsors. Everyone knows, of course, about Trumps gambling operations and of the wide-ranging links of the gambling industry to organized crime. But the story is much bigger than that.",0

(ABC) Brides-to-be looking to shed that final 10, 15 or 20 pounds in order to fit into their dream wedding gown have taken a controversial approach to crash dieting that involves inserting a feeding tube into their noses for up to 10 days for a quick fix to rapid weight loss. The K-E diet, which boasts promises of shedding 20 pounds in 10 days, is an increasingly popular alternative to ordinary calorie-counting programs. The program has dieters inserting a feeding tube into their nose that runs to the stomach. Theyre fed a constant slow drip of protein and fat, mixed with water, which contains zero carbohydrates and totals 800 calories a day. Body fat is burned off through a process called ketosis, which leaves muscle intact, Dr. Oliver Di Pietro of Bay Harbor Islands, Fla., said. video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player It is a hunger-free, effective way of dieting, Di Pietro said. Within a few hours and your hunger and appetite go away completely, so patients are actually not hungry at all for the whole 10 days. Thats what is so amazing about this diet.

"Title: National Data | Why Immigrants In Los Angeles (AND THEIR U.S.-BORN CHILDREN) Can`t Read | Articles  Article: If you were told that more than half of the adult inhabitants of the 17th largest economy in the world couldn't read, you would probably think it was a less developed country like Pakistan or Nigeria. Well, think again. The place is in the good old US of A.: Los Angeles. A new study by the United Way of Los Angeles finds that 53 percent of the city's adult population3.8 million peopleare functionally illiterate. [United Way, Literacy@Work: The L.A. Workforce Literacy Project, September 2004.] The percentage soars to 84 percent in heavily Hispanic south L.A., dropping to 44 percent in the greater San Fernando Valley. [Table 1.] When we last checked, only 41 percent of Los Angeles' population was foreign-born. (See U.S. Census Bureau, The Foreign Born Population: 2000, December 2003). Thus the illiteracy problem in that city is not limited to immigrants. Many of their U.S.-born children must also be functionally illiterate. But the ultimate cause of LA illiteracy is mass immigration. Directly, it constantly resupplies the illiterate pool. Indirectly, it overwhelms the assimilative mechanism. The quality of English instruction for native non-Hispanic Angelenos must also suffer when resources are diverted to classes full of immigrants (Not that anyone seems to care). Here are figures for 2000:  Limited English Fluency: L.A. County: 31 percent; U.S.: 8 percent  Adults w/o HS diploma: L.A. County 30 percent; U.S.: 20 percent  High School Dropout Rate: L.A.

The Fed and Congress can reverse those issues in a finger snap. Our trouble is coming from the barrel of a gun from rabid paranoids and the people on the take. Include also, terrified legislators staring down that barrel from clever manipulators like Karl Rove, in the employ of filthy rich maggots with no conscience. The farce that is the congressional reaction to the Sandy Hook Bushmaster Childrens Slaughter (BCS) continues unabated. A Senate Judiciary Panel was holding a February 27 hearing on a bill laughingly described as an assault weapons ban (with a mere 2,200 exceptions). Before them was a tearful construction worker Neil Heslin. Hes the father of 1 of the 20 BCS child victims, cherubic, six-year-old Jesse Lewis Heslin. He held up a framed photo portrait of Jesse sitting on his dads lap, the picture the very quintessence of a loving parent-child relationship. Neither the grieving parent or the portrait seemed to emotionally change a single expression or mind of the right-wing gun worshiping members of the panel. Most of whom were wondering which fancy restaurant the gun lobbyists would spring for after the ordeal of hearing yet another sob story was over. Heslin had also appeared as one of numerous invitees to a series of General Assembly Task Force hearings held in several rooms of the Legislative Office Building about five weeks prior to the Senate Judiciary Panel. An estimated 1,500 NRA gun nuts were out in force. Some of them split off into the room where Heslin was testifying.",1
"Title: Frank Talk (Like Trump's) Is A Relief After Years Of ""Stilted Robotic Artificiality"" | Blog Posts  Article: There's an interesting sentence in a fund-raising letter I just received from the Claremont Institute. The Claremont, California-based think tank, which publishes the excellent Claremont Review of Books quarterly, has as their overarching theme ""Recovering the American Idea: The mission of the Claremont Institute is to restore the principles of the American Founding to their rightful, preeminent authority in our national life."" In the letter, institute president Ryan Williams explains, ""Today, the Claremont Institute is focused more than ever on how to think about this critical political moment in our nation's history. And what it means for the future of limited government and American constitutionalism."" All well and goodindeed, I'm a (very modest) donor. More intriguing, though, is a later statement in Williams's letter about how the institute's Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence is weighing in, with amicus briefs, on cases before the U.S. Supreme Court including:  Trump v. Hawaii -- In this case, we are supporting the administration's executive authority for national security executive orders blocking immigration from terrorist-infested countries. Terrorist-infested!

"Title: Argentina: 128-year-old man claims he is Adolf Hitler  Article: An elderly man from Salta in Argentina claims that hes the infamous German dictator Adolf Hitler and that he spent the last 70 years in hiding. In an interview with the ultra-conservative newspaper El Patriota, the naturalized German immigrant explains that he arrived in the country in 1945 with a passport identifying him Herman Guntherberg. He claims that his passport was a fake one produced by the Gestapo near the end of the war and that hes actually the former Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler. He says hes decided to come out of hiding after the Israeli secret services officially abandoned their policy of pursuing former Nazi war criminals last year. Ive been blamed for a lot of crimes that Ive never committed. Because of that, Ive had to spend more than half of my life hiding from Jews, so Ive had my punishment already. The elderly man claims hes preparing to publish his autobiography in order the restore his public image. Ive been depicted as a bad guy only because we lost the war. When people read my side of the story, it will change the way the perceive me. He says his book will be written under the name Adolf Hitler and should be available in September. Many people, including his wife of 55 years, Angela Martinez, believe that Herman Guntherberg isnt really Adolf Hitler, but is simply suffering from dementia. Ms. Martinez claims her husband never spoke about Hitler until approximately two years ago when he began showing signs of Alzheimers disease. Sometimes, he would forget who I was and where he was.

But, in the outgoing interview the former DNC Chairman was asked why in two words we lost the Presidential Election in 2004. His response, ""National Security"". We had the advantage in 2008, I think but there is nothing in life that is a guarantee. We need to have someone on the ticket who has National Security experience. Unfortunately, most of the leading contenders do not. That's okay, there is no requirement in our constitution to have military or National Security experience to be the Commander in Chief. But isn't it going to be useful in 2008? Aren't we going to have one hell of a mess on our hands? Isn't it going to be easier to convince Moderates and Independents in this country that we aren't ""far left"". We have a second chance, a second opportunity to get things right in 2008. John Kerry and John Edwards aren't in the White House because of National Security. Kerry's War Service, was not enough. So who do we have? Bob Kerry, out. Jack Reed, out. John Kerry, out.

Article: Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Tom Homan ripped into House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) after she made comments that President Trump had used ICE in the San Francisco Bay area to terrorize the people there. ""Just last week, President Trump decided to terrorize innocent immigrant families in the Bay Area with his unjust and cruel raids,"" Pelosi said on Wednesday, March 7 following a series of arrests of illegals by ICE. The people of California will not be bowed by the Trump administrations brazen aggression and intimidation tactics,"" the California Democrat said.

Overall, in the California arrests, 81% of those arrested were also convicted criminals. Her quote was beyond the pale, Homan said.

"Title: Not again Looks like McCain will get his bomb, bomb Iran after all  Article: Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. President Donald Trump is praising anti-government protesters in Iran and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley says the administration is intent on helping to amplify the voices of the Iranian people. This is a dance weve seen before. Where does it end? Well, probably with a big smile on Sen. John McCains face. Remember when the psychotic senator sang for a crowd, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran to the tune of the Beach Boys Barbara Ann at a 2007 campaign stop? Were getting close. Demonstrations kicking up across Iran are creating a perfect atmosphere for the Trump administration to jump into some good old fashioned democracy spreadin. Joy. As reported by The Washington Post:  The demonstrations, which started last week over frustrations about the economy but quickly shifted to political grievances, came two and a half months after Trump unveiled a new strategy to counter Iran and reverse what he sees as the Obama administrations lax approach. Later this month, Trump will have a chance to move beyond strong rhetoric when he is decides whether to certify that Iran is complying with the 2015 nuclear deal. But the protests are providing an earlier window into the administrations policies as it struggles to decide how to react to demonstrations that are evolving differently than the last big protests in Iran in 2009 over election fraud. At least initially, the two American presidents used similar language, including a key catchphrase. Trumps already taking the bait.",0
