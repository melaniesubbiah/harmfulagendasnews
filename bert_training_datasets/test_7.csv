"Title: GE's Big Brother  Article: The Obama administration has come under scrutiny for its ties to several large corporations, including the auto industry giants General Motors and Chrysler, whose bailout it engineered last spring. But one corporate connection has not received similar scrutiny. Since 2008, General Electric has been cozying up to the Obama administration. The relationship is sure to result in financial gain for GE, while likely granting the company greater access and influence. The arrangements set forth are legal, but the potential impact the interconnections may have  and the blatant kickbacks that have been offered  should alarm Americans. In a Washington Examiner op-ed, journalist Timothy Carney points out the eyebrow-raising ties between President Barack Obama's team and GE's leadership. According to Carney, GE CEO Jeff Immelt sits on Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, and GE owns MSNBC, the network famously friendly to Obama. Immeltss place on the board is concerning for a number of reasons. First and foremost, GE has been the recipient of bailout funds and stands to benefit from current and future contracts with the U.S. government. This may partly explain MSNBCs highly favorable treatment of the Obama administration. With GEs CEO sitting on Obamas economic panel, it is no surprise that MSNBC rarely provides critical coverage of the administration. Furthermore, GEs environmental business interests may explain why NBC recently joined Hollywood in inserting environmentally-friendly messaging into network programming.",0
"Title: We call this device a mother? Holy Father ashamed by nickname given to MOAB  Article: The New York Posts Seth Mandel called it a few weeks back when he predicted that someone would be triggered not just by the dropping of the MOAB on an ISIS compound in Afghanistan but by the nickname itself. ""MOAB is both sexist and normative/exclusionary. Time to call it something else."" take we will probably hear at some point today  Seth Mandel (@SethAMandel) April 13, 2017 By that time, someone had already lodged a complaint against referring to the epitome of lethal patriarchy by such a grotesque nickname as the Mother of All Bombs. He was a little late, but Pope Francis got in on the discussion Saturday, managing to complicate the issue exponentially. What does an enlightened progressive do when the head of the Catholic Church appears to take a shot at the patriarchy by praising life-giving motherhood?

"Title: Troubled South Bend abortion facility to cease abortions Friday  Article: NewsAbortion South Bend, IN, November 4, 2015 (OperationRescue)  Womens Pavillion, the last abortion clinic in South Bend, Indiana, will halt abortions on Friday, November 6, 2015, making the South Bend area abortion-free. The clinics troubled owner, abortionist Ulrich Klopfer, will surrender his facility license now that he has dropped his appeal of a decision issued in June by the Indiana State Department of Health to revoke the Womens Pavillions operating license. The ISDH notified Klopfer of its intent to revoke the Womens Pavillion facility license in June after he failed to adequately correct numerous deficiencies discovered by inspectors. Klopfer still faces possible revocation of his medical license or other discipline for hundreds of violations related to failing to include required information from state reporting forms and failing to report suspected child sex abuse in a timely manner. Klopfers pattern of omitting critical information on the state-mandated reporting forms served to cover up for child rapists and made it nearly impossible for the State to investigate suspected cases of child sex abuse or determine whether the abortions done by Klopfer were within the legal gestational limits in Indiana. Womens Pavillion was raided by police serving a search warrant in March, 2014. Klopfer was criminally charged with failing to report suspected child sex abuse. We have no idea how many little girls were handed back to their abusers by Klopfer. He did everything he could to protect the rapists at the expense of the safety of little girls that depended on him to save them.",1
"Title: Occult Inc: Artist Azealia Banks Releases Disgusting Vid + Geldof Daughters Satanic Sex Cult  Article: By 21st Century Wire says The business of selling satanic and occult concepts has proved to be a lucrative one  thanks to the music industry. One of the fundamental problems with the corporate entertainment industry is that through its big budget marketing and paid-for media reach, its able to exert undo influence over its target market of teens and pre-teen children with its overt promotion of occult symbols and imagery. The balance of influence is overwhelmingly tipped in favour of a handful of media multinationals, and these are the results This latest monstrosity by their latest willing agitprop front girl, artist Azealia Banks, is probably one of the most in-your-face examples of what the entertainment industrys mission currently is: a cultural psy-op which is pressing ahead with the simultaneous program to proliferate satanic imagery and symbolism together with the increased sexualisation of young people and the promotion of paedophilia. The idea behind this media-wide program is to make all these things appear as acceptable, or the new normal. They have more of less succeeded in capturing an entire generation. The political and legal agenda being pushed by this tight-knit ring of interest is to lower the age of consent  or in other words, to legalise sex with ever younger children, opening new markets for predators and their most lucrative enterprise prostitution.",1
"Title: More Options For Trump On The Caravan: Make Applicants For Asylum Wait IN MEXICO | Blog Posts  Article: It is good to hear that finally the President is getting some good advice on how to deal with the Caravan of Death To America By Demographic Displacement. In a surprisingly fair and balanced report, CNN outlines what advice the President is considering. I am not certain how he is getting this advice, as DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen (Lady DACA) is clearly in over her head, and she does not appear to be committed to defeating the Caravan. There might be some backdoor to the President, such as Stephen Miller or L. Francis Cissna, Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Importantly, the advice filtering through to the President is just what I myself recommend, vigorous use of executive authority based on the successful Muslim Ban, but missing some other important adviceto fully and faithfully implement Expedited Removal. Ignore the misleading headline (Could Violate Federal Law), thats just CNN being CNNthe substance of the article is fair. As a migrant caravan hundreds of miles away moves toward the United States, the Trump administration is weighing its options on trying to block entry to the United States and possibly narrow the category of individuals who can apply for asylum. While the administration argues publicly that it wants to bolster US capabilities at the border, immigrant rights groups warn that if the government attempts to limit asylum seekers from receiving a fair hearing, they will rush to court. The dispute, with no firm policy in place, comes in the shadow of the midterm elections and could prompt a massive legal battle.",1
"Title: Man turns himself in to the FBI for killing Abraham Lincoln in 1865  Article: Washington, D.C. | A man from Virginia turned himself in at the FBI headquarters this morning, claiming that he was guilty of killing more than 30 people, including the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. 71-year old Leroy Timothy Anderson, claims he worked for 35 years as a time traveling assassin for a secret governmental agency, and says he has killed people in various times, going from 1678 to 2239. The elderly man declared that his actions were all legitimate and ordered by the government, but that he fears his former employers might want to eliminate him because he knows too much. He claims that he was part a program called the Chronos Project, which was designed, coordinated, and executed by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States special operations forces, under the supervision of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). This ultra-secret program would have orchestrated more than 1200 assassinations, spreading out over almost all of human history, including many famous characters like Martin Luther King Jr, Julius Cesar or Mahatma Gandhi. His story was clearly one of the most fascinating that I have ever heard, said FBI director, James Corney. Mr. Anderson not only claims to have killed President Lincoln, but also 32 others, including at least twelve are not even born yet. I know that conspiracy theorists will accuse us of covering up Lincolns murder and stuff like that, but the FBI isnt going to open an investigation.",0

"" Lee was responding to comments by his colleague, Utah's senior U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch, a seven-term Republican. On Wednesday, Hatch made national news for saying that ""the trend right now in the courts is to permit gay marriage, and anybody who doesn't admit that just isnt living in the real world."" He said while he doesn't think that's the right way to go...I do accept whatever the courts say.

"Title: THE EXPERIENCE MEME  Article: The argument Republicans have been making that Obama has insufficient experience seems to me, on a little reflection, able to be shown as an essentially typical Republican (AND VERY ELITIST, AS REPUBLICANS REALLY ARE BY NATURE) position, reflecting the notion that ONLY those annointed by providence (by being in a favored position, usually by birth or wealth - or by being the handmaidens of those people) are fit to lead; and Obama clearly doesnt fit into that category, despite all his sterling qualities (which recitation is part of the Republican argument structure because the truth of those qualities is so obvious, and therefore must be countered somehow by means of this argument) essentially because he has not been around long enough to become part of the elite club of people who ARE qualified to lead (which could only happen, really, by his being accepted by those people - whatever such acceptance might cost).",0
"Title: America's Immigration Voice.  Article: Before the installation of Loretta Lynch as Attorney General, Senator Jeff Sessions (not for nothing called ""America's Senator"") said he wouldn't support her nomination because she supported the right of illegal aliens to work in this country. Sessions was right, but she was confirmed anyway. The day after a horrific shooting spree by what appears to be a radicalized Muslim man and his partner in San Bernardino, California, Attorney General Loretta Lynch pledged to a Muslim advocacy and lobbying group that she would take aggressive action against anyone who used ""anti-Muslim rhetoric"" that ""edges toward violence."" Speaking to the audience at the Muslim Advocates' 10th anniversary dinner Thursday, Lynch said her ""greatest fear"" is the ""incredibly disturbing rise of anti-Muslim rhetoric"" in America and vowed to prosecute any guilty of what she deemed violence-inspiring speech.

"Title: Dresden's annihilation shown in World War Two video  Article: Harrowing footage from World War Two showing the annihilation of the German city of Dresden by Allied forces has resurfaced on the anniversary of the bombings which killed up to 25,000 people. Video from 1945, shown as part of an American news report, shows the fearsome bomb attacks undertaken by the RAF on the night of February 13. One shot from the footage shows an RAF plane being struck by an anti-aircraft gun, which the narrator describes as a 'scarecrow' in his voiceover. The clip also shows American bombers moving over the east German city the following day, where they dropped more bombs in an effort to stop Hitler's forces fending off the Soviet advance from the east. At the start of the clip, with the American narrator describing the Allied attacks, British bombers are seen high above the Saxony city. Dresden is then seen at night, with the aerial view showing the terrifying sound and light of the explosions. One British plane falls victim to the 'scarecrow', which the narrator calls 'Goebbels's secret weapon', with a frightening explosion in the sky. Some 650,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on Dresden's transportation lines by RAF Lancaster planes, according to the narrator, hampering the German forces. The bombings then continue to ravage the city before American bombers from the Eighth Air Force are seen leaving vapour trails behind them as they join in the attack.",0

Through our inaction, we have been brought to the doorstep of destruction Final countdown to World War III It was precisely three years ago when I wrote that World War III will begin in Syria. I wrote that Syria, not Iran, will be the flashpoint between the United States and Russia, based on information given to me by a source within our own intelligence community. I wrote that we were seeing the final acts of a carefully choreographed play being performed on the world stage, where the script was written long ago by the globalist playwrights.

No one will be left untouched by the coming events. We are at the precipice of World War III. That was in October of 2012. Today, we are now seeing the final curtain call for the next act by the current headline in the corporate controlled mass media: Russia has begun airstrikes in Syria, the West is disputing their targets, and Putin has told the U.S. and the West to stand down.

For the first time, fingerprints and biographical information sent to the FBI for a background check will be stored and searched right along with fingerprints taken for criminal purposes. The change, which the FBI revealed quietly in a February 2015 Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), means that if you ever have your fingerprints taken for licensing or for a background check, they will most likely end up living indefinitely in the FBIs NGI database. Theyll be searched thousands of times a day by law enforcement agencies across the countryeven if your prints didnt match any criminal records when they were first submitted to the system.

"Title: Rubio Sacrificed His Campaign to Save America  Article: Marco Rubios campaign ended yesterday. He wont acknowledge it and neither will his hardcore supporters for some days, but he is done. It was one thing when he was running more or less even with Cruz across the South, like he did on Super Tuesday, but Rubio has clearly lost his mojo, finishing behind Kasich in Maine and well behind Cruz in Kentucky and Louisiana. Rubio is running out of gas both metaphorically and physically. This is now a race between Cruz and Trump. I say this as a guy who a couple weeks ago endorse Rubio as the best chance to beat Trump. However, if I were Ted Cruz, I would be hoping that Marco Rubio does not drop out yet, at least not until after Thursday. Because the reason that Cruz was able to reach up and stun Donald Trump yesterday is that Rubio has picked apart Trumps vanity and caused him to self-immolate in a way that no candidate has been able to either before or since. Rubio was able to expose Trumps business record in a way that Cruz never was. Moreover, Rubios insult comic routine exposed what an ugly, shallow, insincere man Trump is to an electorate that was almost ready to embrace him as inevitable. Unfortunately, it also seems to have had the effect that it has destroyed Rubios chances at obtaining the nomination himself. Many voters who were horrified by Trumps response were equally horrified by Rubios behavior that provoked it.",0
"Title: Critics: Its 1929 again! as Trump announces farmer bailout  Article: President Donald Trumps insanely bad policy of engaging in a trade war with China just got worse. Hes now announced hes spending $12 billion on a short term stimulus plan  read corporate welfare  to prop up farmers hurt by the trade war. Chinas retaliation for tariffs on its products was to place levies on 545 categories of U.S. products ranging from soybeans, pork, chicken and seafood to sport-utility vehicles and electric vehicles. As a result, orders for product have been cut, backing up inventory and causing export prices to plunge. It was apparently Trumps plan all along to set up a bailout for farmers. Back in April he instructed Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to devise a plan to mitigate any financial damage to farmers bottom line. The aid package will consist of direct payments, food purchases and trade development, with more details on the program to come by Labor Day, according to Perdue and top officials.

"Title: Straight Outta Harlem Hillary Jets to SF to $350,000 Fundraiser. Peasants to Protest Outside Gates.  Article: Let them eat cake! After spending a few minutes visiting a low income housing project in Harlem today, Hillary jetted out to hang with her people at a private fundraiser. Around 2000 peasants are expected to protest the event: George and Amal Clooney, coupled with Hillary Clinton will be hosting a fundraising dinner in San Francisco on April 15th. ""The fundraiser is for The Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee for Hillary for America, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic committees of 32 states and Puerto Rico"" (fortune.com/...). The dinner costs $300,000+ to attend for a couple, and around $33,000 for an individual to be able to dine at the table with celebrities and to take a photo with Hillary Rodham Clinton. Let the people of San Francisco gather and march through the main streets of Nob Hill to protest this event and to show Hillary Clinton that we don't accept this kind of corruption. Rich people should not be allowed to buy politicians. Imagine, for example, how far $30,000 could go to help the homelessness problem in San Francisco. This corruption-fest is not just undemocratic, it is immoral and obscene! The very least we can do is to remind Hillary's rich donors of the corruption they are a part of. We will protest outside the event so that none of the attendants can chose to close their eyes to criticism and insulate themselves from the people in a fancy dinner. We are the people! We refuse to be excluded! We demand to be heard! They don't want us there. We will be there! Bring your own posters and banners!",0
"Title: NEO  Crimea, China and Alternative Trade Routes  Article: [ Editors note: One of the reasons that growth is so key to a nations future is that it creates demand for infrastructure projects, which in developed countries increases the velocity of money when the components and labor are local. Modern US problems with this model have included the large presence of many Mexican workers on American construction projects prior to our collapse. For third world countries, we find huge equipment imports associated with big projects, where the local labor money stays, but no demand for the bigger ticket machinery items is ever created. When the projects are done, the anticipated ripple effect is a fizzle, as the profits generated are further spent on imports of parked offshore. China has weathered the world recession with continued growth because of its continued domestic development and also its well-diversified export portfolio, the envy of the world actually. Thus, the US elites recast this success as a national security threat to the US declining economy, and decided to use its forward military deployment to threaten Chinas trading routes, those going to China with energy, and then its ocean-carried exports. Washingtons pitiful spin-meistering that this policy is driven by commitment to protect its security partners from some growing Chinese military menace is laughable, if it were not so sad. Unlike the US, the Chinese do not establish military bases along their trade routes as the price of doing business with them. Why would China want to project a future military threat that would divert potential trade revenues into the hands of the military industrial complex (America) versus expanding trade with them?",0
"Title: Senator Flake's Sad, Pathetic and Ignorant Speech  Article: Senator Flake, a politician who works hard at pretending to believe something, gave a speech attacking the President of the United States for criticizing the media. This Doonesbury character come to life 'courageously' delivered a speech defending major media conglomerates and their right to override elections. Because he loves freedom and truth. The speech perfectly captured Flake's insipid cluelessness. It reads like it was written by a college sophomore who is very passionate about ideas, but doesn't actually understand them. Take his opening. ""Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident ..."" So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America."" It's an applause line, but no one's applauding except the leftist media that hates the founders and Jefferson. It's also a line that could have only been produced by googling, ""founders"" and ""truth"". Jefferson wasn't writing about truth, as Flake invokes it, but about the principles on which this nation is based. And he's saying that being self-evident, they don't require further philosophical proofs. It has nothing to do with ""shared facts between the governed and the government."" That's a creepy prog idea with a whiff of 1984.",1
"Title: Washington and Allies Go Orwellian  Article: Just as North and South Korea achieve important peaceful exchanges, Washington and its NATO allies appear to be moving with determination to sabotage the initiative for averting war on the East Asian peninsula. Further, the reckless, gratuitous provocations beg the conclusion that the United States is indeed trying to start a war. Meanwhile, unprecedented accusations this week by US President Donald Trump that Russia is supporting North Korea to evade United Nations sanctions also point to the danger that any conflict could spiral out of control to engulf world nuclear powers. Moscow rejected the unsubstantiated claims leveled by Trump, saying that Russia is abiding by UN trade restrictions over North Korea, and that the American presidents allegations were entirely unfounded. Trumps verbal broadside suggests that Washington is trying to undermine the nascent talks between the two Koreas, talks which Russia and China have both applauded as a long-overdue diplomatic effort to resolve the Korean conflict. Separately, Russias Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov deplored a summit held in Vancouver, Canada, earlier this week in which the US and 19 other nations  most of them NATO members  called for sharper sanctions on North Korea that go beyond the remit of the United Nations. The conference, co-hosted by Canadas Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, issued a stridently bellicose statement, calling in effect for North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons or face US-led military action. Significantly, and pointedly, China and Russia were not invited to the Canadian summit.",1

We experience two quite different offerings at Travelodge, Sampford Peverell Service Area, Sampford Peverell, M5 (Junction 27), near Tiverton and at The Barn and Pinn Cottage, near Sidmouth. The Travelodge is up to 40 minutes away from the Regency seaside town. Visitors to this hotel know what to expect; the basics: a bed and en-suite accommodationnothing fancy. There is no restaurant at this particular Travelodge although cereal and juice can be purchased for breakfast for 5.25 per person. Theres also free car parking. We stay in a family room because our son Henry (18 months) is accompanying us and so there is room for his travel cot. But I notice that there is a pull out bed underneath the double bed as well as another bed in the corner of the room, so it would be possible for our family of five to stay, if necessary. Theres a double bed and en-suite bathroom. The staff are helpful and friendly and even though it is quite close to the motorway it is not even a distant rumble away thanks to good double glazing. Whenever we stay in a Travelodge they are always popular and this is no different, a variety of guests ranging from trades people to business people. The highlight of our stay is the fact that there is actually a bath. Most travellers may not bat an eyelid at this but since moving to our new home which currently only has a shower room, we miss our bath. The taps have really good pressure too meaning that the bath fills up really quickly.",0
"Title: Jeff Sessions, Just What Side of the Constitution are You on?  Article: I'm so sick and tired of wishy-washy politicians who talk a good game and when it comes time for action, they go AWOL. Such is the case with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Before you blast me, hear me out. Most of you who read what I write know I'm not a liberal. So, if anyone wants to bash me as such, you are doing so knowing you are misrepresenting me. Has Jeff Sessions done some good things? Of course! He's taken a verbal stand for the Constitution when it comes to authorization for war. Of course, he failed to actually bring any resolve in the matter. He's also overseen a lot of enforcement of both immigration law and child pornography and human trafficking arrests. However, let me lay out a specific case in which Jeff Sessions, a proponent of unconstitutional asset forfeiture, speaks regarding free speech. First, consider a recent speech by Sessions in which he warned about the Supreme Court's ruling concerning unconstitutional ""free speech zones,"" whatever those are. Following the speech, I'll demonstrate the hypocrisy that is going one. Here's the speech. Thank you for that kind introduction. I am so pleased to be here at Georgetown Law and to be speaking at the Georgetown Center for the Constitution where the exchange of ideas is both welcomed and encouraged. Thank you, Professor Barnett for that introduction and for hosting me here with your students. And thank you students for letting me take part in this important conversation with you. As you embark on another school year, you and hundreds of your peers across this campus will, we hope, continue the intellectual journey that is higher education.",0
"Title: Gay Marriage Ruling Hasnt Dissuaded Conservatives  Article: Californians have seen it before. From the overturn of voter approved Proposition 8 and Proposition 22 to this weeks U.S. Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges to institute homosexual marriage in all 50 states, judges overruled the will of the people. Proposition 8 is the 2008 ballot measure that California voters approved 52.3% to 47.7%, upholding marriage as the union between a man and a woman. It passed in the blue state the same year liberals came out in force to elect Barack Obama the first time around. Chief U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker later overturned the measure. Fridays 5-4 Supreme Court decision to force every state to issue homosexual marriage licenses included the supportive vote of Justice Kennedy. Republican 2016 presidential candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz called the marriage ruling as well as Thursdays ruling upholding Obamacare, both naked and shameless judicial activism. Breitbart News Ben Shapiro wrote of Justice Kennedys opinion, Justice Kennedy just redefined a fundamental right and forced elected state governments to slap their stamp of approval on that right. Justice Kennedy was also one of five justices voting to overturn the President Bill Clinton signed Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 2013. As the Court struck down DOMA, it also decided to refrain from a substantive ruling on Prop 8. The lower court decision to overturn the measure stood. Justice Kennedy dissented the decision to not issue a ruling. A ruling against Prop 8 at the Supreme Court level could have invalidated similar measures in other states.",1
"Title: Sound Waves Reveal Huge Cache of Diamonds  Article: Study finds 12 percent of Earths oldest mantle rocks are made from diamond. From MIT:  There may be more than a quadrillion tons of diamond hidden in the Earths interior, according to a new study from MIT and other universities. But the new results are unlikely to set off a diamond rush. The scientists estimate the precious minerals are buried more than 100 miles below the surface, far deeper than any drilling expedition has ever reached. The ultradeep cache may be scattered within cratonic roots  the oldest and most immovable sections of rock that lie beneath the center of most continental tectonic plates. Shaped like inverted mountains, cratons can stretch as deep as 200 miles through the Earths crust and into its mantle; geologists refer to their deepest sections as roots. In the new study, scientists estimate that cratonic roots may contain 1 to 2 percent diamond. Considering the total volume of cratonic roots in the Earth, the team figures that about a quadrillion (1016) tons of diamond are scattered within these ancient rocks, 90 to 150 miles below the surface. This shows that diamond is not perhaps this exotic mineral, but on the [geological] scale of things, its relatively common, says Ulrich Faul, a research scientist in MITs Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences. We cant get at them, but still, there is much more diamond there than we have ever thought before.",0
"Title: Trump Exposed Sabotaging Already Fragile U.K. Relations With Highly Petty Demands  Article: Donald Trump cast himself as a supposedly amazing deal maker while coming into office, promising to restore Americas position in the world, but in reality, hes only caused our position in the world to worsen in the minds of many. Instead of the respected leader we once were, under the Trump administration, the United States  at least its government  has devolved into even more of an apparent laughingstock than it was before. A new report from Bloomberg outlines just how such has come about in the case of our relationship with the United Kingdom. According to the publication, Trump hasnt limited his whining about the treatment he receives from the press to his public statements, including those offered on Twitter. Rather, according to Bloomberg, during a phone conversation with British Prime Minister Theresa May last year, Trump went so far as to complain to the British leader about the negative coverage of him in the British press. He apparently insisted at the time that he wouldnt be accepting the U.K.s offer of a state visit unless May could assure him that he would receive a warm welcome.",0

Euthanasia and assisted suicide are killing, plain and simple. We cannot allow killing to be confused with health care in Quebec, said Linda Couture, director of Living with Dignity.

British journalist Rossalyn Warren raised a rallying cry to abortion advocates to lobby Facebook to black out sites like LifeNews and Live Action, which she accused of producing vast amounts of misinformation  such as the correlation between abortion and breast cancer. Indeed, articles from these sites are more shared on Facebook than evidence-based, credible articles about abortion from reputable news outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post, she complained. According to Warren, whose work has appeared in the Guardian and Buzzfeed, the problem is that Facebooks criteria to assess whats fake news doesnt generally apply to pro-life sites.

"Title: Jobs Update: More Jobs For Bartenders, As Factory Workers Lose Jobs  Article: [See also National Data, By Edwin S. Rubenstein: A Cold February for White Workers] March 10. The BLS payroll jobs report released today lists 205,000 new private sector jobs for February. As has been the case for a number of years, the new jobs are in domestic nontradable services.

All of this began on Friday when #ReleaseTheMemo hit Twitter. While Rolling Stone magazine claims that Russian bots (ie. Boris and Natasha of Bullwinkle fame ) were responsible for the popularity of the hashtag, the reality was that people simply want to see the evidence for themselves. The American public does not trust anyone in DC and they want the document made public so they can decide for themselves.",1
"Title: The mother of all jets  Article: This picture just screams ""Jet Age!"" A B-47 using rocket assist and water injection for takeoff. The origin of the B-47 actually goes back to 1943 when the Army put out a proposal for a jet powered bomber/reconnaissance aircraft. Jets were still in their very early stages in 1943 but the Army was looking a few years down the road. Boeings initial design used a conventional straight wing and would have looked a lot like a B-29 with jet engines. Except by then it was 1945 and we had discovered the German (of course) research on swept wings. Im actually surprised it took us until 1945 to figure this out. Wed already seen German ME-262s with swept wings that were 100 mph faster than anything we had. Boeing went back to the drawing board. No, really, they used drawing boards in those days. They redesigned their prototype to incorporate our knew aerodynamic knowledge. Now the tricky part, where do we stick the engines? The British liked to bury the engines in the wing root. This certainly made for a clean looking design. I think the De Havilland Comet is still one of the best looking jets ever built. It just looks right. The problems with burying the engines are three-fold. Maybe more than that but I can only think of three right now: 1. The wing has to be fairly thick to make room for the engines. 2. Its hard to get at the engines to work on them. 3. Thats not really where you want them to be if one catches on fire or goes explody. The Boeing engineers decided that slinging the engines on pylons under the wing was the way to go. This let them build a nice thin wing and made the engines much easier to get at.",0
"Title: Pakistan Builds A Wall On Afghanistan Border To Control The Flow Of Terrorists  Article: In order to attempt to curtail the flow of terrorist between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the former country is building a wall on the border it shares with the latter. For the better security of our country and nation, we had to do this work, a Pakistani army official, Brig. Nisar. Nisar, who only uses one name, told journalists during a government-organized visit to the border that this is in Pakistans security interest. The barrier has angered the Afghan government, which disputes the location of the boundary and says the fence will tear communities apart. According to NBC News, construction began last year on two fences that parallel each other as they snake through the remote, mountainous landscape. Standing 13 feet high on the Afghan side and 11 feet on the Pakistani side, sharp spirals of silver barbed wire are cradled at the top of each. Additional coils of barbed wire have been placed on the ground in the gap between the fences, which are dotted with Pakistani military towers. Pakistans military says it will have 92 percent of the national border fenced before the end of 2019. Only three miles of the 789-mile stretch of the border along the remote southwestern province of Balochistan has been fenced so far, according to a military official who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity. However, there are some parts of the border will not be fenced as they are too mountainous. Many have questioned the efficacy of border walls, and whether or not the cost is worth the outcome. But if the goal is reducing an influx of human beings, there is at least some real-world evidence that border walls are effective.",0
"Title: Patrick J. Buchanan: Is Mayor de Blasio an Anti-Asian Bigot? | Articles  Article: Though New York City has one of the most segregated schoolsystems in the country, writes Elizabeth Harris of The New York Times, until now, Mayor Bill de Blasio ""was all but silent on the issue."" He was ""reluctant even to use the word 'segregation.'"" Now the notion that the liberal mayor belongs in the same basket as Southern governors in the '50s and '60s like Orval Faubus of Arkansas and Ross Barnett of Mississippi seems a bit of a stretch. For what Harris [Email her] means by ""segregation"" is that in the city's eight most prestigious schools, like Stuyvesant High School and the Bronx School of Science, where admission is by written test, the makeup of the student body does not remotely resemble the racial diversity of the city. ""Black and Hispanic students make up nearly 70 percent of the city's public school students,"" writes Harris, ""but they received just 10 percent of offers for seats at specialized schools this fall."" ""About 27 percent of the offers went to white students who make up 15 percent of the student system; 52 percent went to Asian students, who up make 16 percent."" Harris later adjusted her numbers. Asians are 62 percent of students. At Stuyvesant, only 10 of 900 students being admitted this fall are black. At Stuyvesant, The Wall Street Journal writes ""2.8% of students are Latino and 0.69% black. But 72.9% are Asian-American."" Harris decries this as ""extreme school segregation."" De Blasio now demands change: ""We must be sure that the very best high schools are open to ... every kind of New Yorker."" The student bodies at the elite public schools ""need to look like New York City.""",0

Israel is attacking Syria more frequently and openly. Today, an Israeli jet was shot down. The U.S. is attacking Syria more openly and forcefully too. The risks of worse warfare to come in Syria are elevating. The U.S. makes the ridiculous claim that it recently acted in self-defense: It was self-defense. Obviously, we are not getting engaged in the Syrian civil war, Secretary of Defense Mattis said. Mattis lies. The lie is evident because the U.S. got engaged years ago by embedding its advisors with Syrian rebel forces. Underscoring its intrusion and presence in Syria, the U.S. declared an open-ended military presence in Syria. Syria condemned this border force in strong terms. The U.S. intervened in the Syrian Civil War within Syrian territory. The U.S. cannot now claim self-defense, the reason being that it has intentionally placed its military personnel in harms way without being invited by Syria. Thats an act of war. The only thing that Mattis can possibly claim is that the U.S. has not yet launched a full-scale attack on Syria and isnt mobilizing forces to do so. But the U.S. retains the option at any time of launching massive attacks from the air whenever it chooses to invoke the justification of self-defense for rebel forces or raise the issue of chemical weapons; and it has now launched several of these attacks.",0
