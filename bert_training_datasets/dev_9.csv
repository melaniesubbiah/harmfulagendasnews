"Title: 6 Things That Happen To Your Body When You Take A Shot Of Apple Cider Vinegar Daily  Article: Weve all heard about the amazing health benefits of apple cider vinegar (acv) right? but we forget to take it or how to use it. Most people add a little bit to the top of their salad when they remember but thats about it. There are so many health benefits from apple cider vinegar that I recommend taking it routinely almost as if its a supplement. Why? well lets take a look at just 6 reasons why you should 1. It Maintains an active Metabolism 2. It maintains an active protein metabolism  This helps the body repair and recover, protein is usable. 3. It Boosts Human Growth Hormone (HGH) (Because Available Protein is a building block for HGH) 4. Acetic acid in ACV helps release iron in food you eat making oxygen carrying hemoglobin (molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen) and myoglobin (Iron & oxygen binding protein,) Myoglobin is the primary oxygen-carrying pigment of muscle tissues (Whales and seals muscles have high levels of myoglobin to store oxygen.) 5. It helps produce insulin which converts glucose into energy 6. Some of the acids help to produce tryptophan and serotonin, benefiting sleep and overall feeling of well-being. Heres a video that describes these in more detail: Apple cider vinegar has so many benefits, but personally one of the reasons I like it best is because of the digestive and metabolism boosting benefits. It is probably the cheapest way to improve your metabolism (others would be drinking more water and incorporating organic lemons and limes) that I know of.",0
"Title: Nintendos War on Women, Minorities and Democracy  Article: Special Investigative Report with Ray Charlston If you are like many people 30 and under you may have grown up on video games. Perhaps your family had a Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo, Gameboy, or a Nintendo 64. Perhaps you or your children own a Nintendo Wii. You may think video games are a harmless hobby or an enjoyable form of recreation, but think again! Video games can promote racism, sexism and anti-democratic attitudes! Nintendo Co. Ltd, headquartered in Kyoto Japan was literally founded on sexism, racism and Japanese Imperialism. Founded in 1889, its hateful legacy continues on to the present. Video games have spread around the world, poisoning the globe with hate. For this special report I will be interviewing Dr. Norman Frederickson of the Campaign for Justice, Equality and Peace. His organization is dedicated to fighting hatred and exposing bigotry and intolerance. RC: Dr. Frederickson, thank you for agreeing to accept this interview. NF: Of course. I was happy to accept your invitation this is a very important issue. One that I might add, I am deeply concerned about. RC: I understand that you have done extensive research into video games, Nintendo games specifically and what youve found has been, more than a little troubling? NF: Yes, indeed. Our children are being taught racism, sexism, colonialism, and even feudalism in these so-called Nintendo video games. What most people dont realize is that the Nintendo company has been around for some time, well before video games were invented. They used to make playing cards and other things. During the World War II era Nintendo like the rest of Japan was infused with Japanese Imperialism.",1
"Title: Christians in the Muslim world: growth and persecution  Article: Opinion December 4, 2013 (BreakPoint) - Its time for another pop-quiz about the persecuted Church: How many Christians reside in Saudi Arabia? Hundreds? Thousands? The answer is an estimated 3 million of the kingdoms 28 million residents. The key words here are reside and resident. Virtually all of these Christians are guest workers from countries such as the Philippines and India. The Saudis may be dependent on their labor, but this dependence doesnt translate into decent treatment, especially when it comes to religious freedom. In his new book, The Global War on Christians, John L. Allen tells us that although in theory, the state tolerates private expressions of alternative religious belief in practice the religious police in Saudi Arabia . . .",0
"Title: Why is the Left so Defensive of Obamas Religion?  Article: For once, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is in trouble for something he didnt say as opposed to something he did. Specifically, hes taking heat for his failure to defend Barack Obama when one of his supporters questioned his Christian faith. We have a problem in this country, said a man attending Trumps rally in New Hampshire Thursday night. Its called Muslims. We know our current president is one. You know hes not even an American  birth certificate, man  We have training camps growing, where they want to kill us. Thats my question. When can we get rid of them? Trump looked around. This is how were starting? After some laughs, Trump went on to say, Were going to be looking at a lot of different things. You know, a lot of people are saying that, and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening out there. Were going to look at that and plenty of other things. Not much meat on the bones of that answer, but that didnt stop a legion of liberal critics from slamming the GOP frontrunner. Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz issued a statement reading: Donald Trumps racism knows no bounds. This is certainly horrendous but unfortunately unsurprising given what we have seen already. The vile rhetoric coming from the GOP candidates is appalling. Others piled on, demanding to know why Trump didnt insist that Obama was both an American and a Christian. Likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was inspired to personally use her Twitter account to say, Donald Trump not denouncing false statements about POTUS & hateful rhetoric about Muslims is disturbing, & just plain wrong.",1
"Title: Not again Looks like McCain will get his bomb, bomb Iran after all  Article: Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. President Donald Trump is praising anti-government protesters in Iran and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley says the administration is intent on helping to amplify the voices of the Iranian people. This is a dance weve seen before. Where does it end? Well, probably with a big smile on Sen. John McCains face. Remember when the psychotic senator sang for a crowd, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran to the tune of the Beach Boys Barbara Ann at a 2007 campaign stop? Were getting close. Demonstrations kicking up across Iran are creating a perfect atmosphere for the Trump administration to jump into some good old fashioned democracy spreadin. Joy. As reported by The Washington Post:  The demonstrations, which started last week over frustrations about the economy but quickly shifted to political grievances, came two and a half months after Trump unveiled a new strategy to counter Iran and reverse what he sees as the Obama administrations lax approach. Later this month, Trump will have a chance to move beyond strong rhetoric when he is decides whether to certify that Iran is complying with the 2015 nuclear deal. But the protests are providing an earlier window into the administrations policies as it struggles to decide how to react to demonstrations that are evolving differently than the last big protests in Iran in 2009 over election fraud. At least initially, the two American presidents used similar language, including a key catchphrase. Trumps already taking the bait.",0
"Title: Documentary shows beauty in the struggle against same-sex attraction  Article: OpinionFaith, Homosexuality Theres a saying about changing the world by telling a good story. When first clicking on the link to watch the newly-released Desire of the Everlasting Hills, you might be suspecting some syrupy presentation on preserving the environment, or perhaps a knockoff of Heaven is for Real. But a few minutes into the film you immediately become drawn into the lives of three individuals  Paul, Dan, and Rilene  who candidly lay bare their souls as they describe their journey through life with same-sex attraction. A little more than halfway through the 60-minute film, youll very likely find yourself crying as they share their testimony to Gods grace breaking through and changing their lives. By the end, youll probably be thanking God that you were able to witness the power of His transforming love in the lives of these people who courageously and humbly tell their stories. How does Desire succeed in telling a good story on such a sensitive and often explosive topic? For one thing, it completely bypasses the characteristic polarization on the homosexuality issue  namely, if you dont support and even advocate for acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle then you must hate and loathe people with same-sex attraction  by simply letting the individuals tell their story. The filmmakers do not ask leading questions, postulate their own theories, or refer to public opinion polls. They simply offer raw storytelling by real individuals who have experienced something life-changing and wish to share it with others. Its real people telling real stories that leave far behind the politically correct narratives.",1
"Title: Tensions high as protesters in San Francisco fight back against Patriot Prayer rally that didnt happen  Article: Last Saturday, the big news wasnt a right-wing rally in Boston that attracted a handful of people; it was the counter-protest, which the mayor estimated at some 40,000 people, some of whom decided to throw rocks and bottles of urine at cops since there were no Nazis about to punch. This Saturday, an even smaller right-wing gathering that was supposed to take place in San Francisco  something called the Patriot Prayer rally  moved to a smaller venue, shrank to a press conference, and then disappeared entirely.

"Title: A Good Leak  Article: Last weekend, the FBI arrested an employee of a corporation in Augusta, Georgia, that had a contract with the National Security Agency and charged her with espionage. Espionage occurs when someone who has been entrusted to safeguard state secrets fails to do so. In this case, the government alleges that the person to whom state secrets had been entrusted is 25-year-old Reality Leigh Winner, who had a top-secret national security clearance. The government claims that Winner downloaded and printed a top-secret NSA report, removed the printed version of the report from her employers premises, and then mailed it to The Intercept, a highly regarded international media outlet that exposes government wrongdoing. The government says it learned of this when folks from The Intercept called the NSA and told agents what they had received and what they planned to publish. After hearing agents describe the potential harm to their work if the full report were to be released, The Intercept agreed to redact certain portions, though it published the bulk of the report. Time to buy old US gold coins The report is startling, as it reveals that the NSA discovered that Russian hackers in late October and early November 2016 planted cookies (attractive, uniquely tailored links) into the websites of 122 American city and county clerks responsible for counting ballots in the The Constitution in Ex...

"Title: Trump Exposed Sabotaging Already Fragile U.K. Relations With Highly Petty Demands  Article: Donald Trump cast himself as a supposedly amazing deal maker while coming into office, promising to restore Americas position in the world, but in reality, hes only caused our position in the world to worsen in the minds of many. Instead of the respected leader we once were, under the Trump administration, the United States  at least its government  has devolved into even more of an apparent laughingstock than it was before. A new report from Bloomberg outlines just how such has come about in the case of our relationship with the United Kingdom. According to the publication, Trump hasnt limited his whining about the treatment he receives from the press to his public statements, including those offered on Twitter. Rather, according to Bloomberg, during a phone conversation with British Prime Minister Theresa May last year, Trump went so far as to complain to the British leader about the negative coverage of him in the British press. He apparently insisted at the time that he wouldnt be accepting the U.K.s offer of a state visit unless May could assure him that he would receive a warm welcome.",0
"Title: The Folks Who Gave us Rand Paul Think Chris Christie Won't Hold Up to Scrutiny %%  Article: The party that has offered us every kook who walks in off the street would really like to wish away New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.

This is Mitt Romney, the same Mitt Romney who all by himself makes the egregiously corrupt Grant administration look like the most honest and above-board administration in American history. As author John Heilemann told Bill Maher Friday, Hes about to come under a level of scrutiny that, for all the attention hes gotten, hes never had before. Heilemann and Mark Halperin, who together co-write Game Change and now, Double Down, concluded that the Romney campaign considered and rejected Christie as a running mate in 2012: Mitt Romneys vettors looked into him really carefully  and they came away with a lot of questions about his background, questions he wouldnt answer. That kind of talk gets Republicans all excited.",0
"Title: Student radio host says tranny on air gets a lesson in liberal censorship (video)  Article: A University of Minnesota-Morris student radio host was thrown off the air and confronted by police when he used the word tranny during an on-air discussion about Antifa violence. UMM student Brandon Albrecht and co-host Taylor Lehmann were discussing the lack of Antifa style violence at their university on a recent episode of their show, Deplorable Radio, when Albrechts remark drew the ire of an unnamed individual who reportedly serves as the station manager. The manager falsely claimed that tranny is hate speech which cant be said on-air because of FCC rules. Heres a report on the incident via The College Fix:  Deplorable Radio is a weekly show on KUMM hosted by students Brandon Albrecht and Tayler Lehmann. Albrecht told The College Fix in an email that the programming is a mix of politics, music, and some random musings about current events locally and around the world. The duo was notified of the cancellation two weeks ago after Albrecht used a controversial word on-air to refer to transgender individuals. During a discussion about the universitys lack of Antifa violence, Albrecht said the campus was too small for a potential violent activist to hide his identity. You know, you can definitely, you see one tranny thats trying to punch someone, Albrecht told The Fix he said on-air. You know its automatically that one guy that you know Im talking about. I bet you know. Im not going to dox anybody and name them on air. But you two know if I say the tranny who looks like hes going to punch someone. Yep. About fifteen minutes later, Albrecht told The Fix, the student station manager came into the studio with a UMMPD officer and told us to leave.",1
"Title: Trump to visit border wall prototypes in March  Article: WASHINGTON  President Donald Trump will travel to California next month on a cross-country trek that will include a visit to eight prototypes for his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, a White House official confirmed Tuesday. The Washington Post first reported the news. The Trump administration has formally asked Congress for $18 billion in wall funding. The presidents immigration overhaul framework proposed a trust fund totaling $25 billion that would include the wall construction monies and be allotted in one lump sum  but as part of a broader immigration deal that has so far eluded lawmakers and the White House. With the Supreme Court on Monday opting against expediting a legal case about Trumps order to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that shields nearly 700,000 undocumented people from deportation, a March 5 deadline to pass a DACA-addressing immigration bill is now moot. That means Trumps proposed border wall project also now is in limbo  which puts fulfilling a major campaign pledge to his base in doubt as the midterm election season heats up. In his signature fashion, Trump on Friday told a conservative audience not to worry about whether he ultimately will get the border barrier built. Dont worry, youre getting the wall, he said at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington. Dont worry, OK? Were getting the wall. The audience, which he at time whipped into a frenzy during his wildly meandering remarks, responded with a chant that helped define his 2016 campaign: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall!",1
"Title: CAIR vs. Ex-Muslim Anni Cyrus  Article: Editor's note: To learn more about Anni Cyrus, visit her site at LiveUpToFreedom.com. The Massachusetts chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) sent out a press release last Friday, calling upon the American Legion Nonantum Post 440 in Newton, Massachusetts to cancel an event featuring Aynaz Anni Cyrus, an ex-Muslim from Iran. Cyrus crime? She knows too much about Islam, and particularly about the institutionalized mistreatment of women under Islamic law, and isnt afraid to speak frankly about what she knows. Said CAIR-MA Executive Director John Robbins: While every American has the right to free speech  even the kind of bigoted and misinformed speech offered by Ms. Cyrus  credible organizations like the American Legion should not provide platforms that imply approval or offer credibility to hate-filled views. CAIR makes similar efforts to shut down any speaker who speaks unwelcome truths about Islam, jihad and Sharia wherever theyre given a mainstream platform, and always claims that these speakers are bigoted and misinformed. When applying these labels to Anni Cyrus, however, CAIR runs into a problem: Cyrus was born in Iran and grew up in the Islamic Republic. Not only was she a Muslim, but she experienced Islam in a nation whose government prides itself on its strict application of Sharia rules. Thus if anyone knows Islam, its Anni Cyrus. Her views are just the opposite of bigoted and misinformed: they were shaped by her own bitter experience. To be sure, the CAIR press release contains a list of inaccurate, defamatory and inflammatory claims about Islam and Muslims that Cyrus has supposedly made, including:  Rape is part of Islam.",1
"Title: Good lapdoggie! After complaints, Politico changes headline to better reflect Clintons tone on leaked audio  Article: An audio clip recorded during Hillary Clintons speech at a private February fundraiser is making the rounds. In the recording, Clinton had this to say about Bernie Sanders base supporters: They are living in their parents basement, Clinton said. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they dont see much of a future. [] If youre feeling like youre consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesnt pay a lot, and doesnt have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. At Politico, the original headline about this story was Clinton mocks Sanders supporters in leaked fundraising recording. And with that, Politico heard complaints from Team Hillary and her backers for claiming that Clinton was mocking Sanders supporters: Just an embarrassing headline for politico.

"Title: Politicians for a new world order Calling for Gun Control through Banning Bullets  InvestmentWatch  Article: by Thinker The concept of banning lead was floated before, but this latest effort to impose back door gun control has all the marking of a tin horn dictator stripping the peasants of any means of resistance. Drop the pretense. All you need to know is WHY IS GOVERNMENT STOCKPILING GUNS, AMMO?, while you are being told you are not allowed to have your own horde. How you answer this question, reveals much about your attitude towards government, and level of concern for protecting yourself from tyrannical edits. It is startling just how much of the population will accept de facto gun control for any trumped up scheme to impose further governmental mastery. SCOPE reports on the recent announcement on M855 ammunition. On 13 February 2015, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATF) released a document [PDF ] that proposed the reclassification of 5.56mm constituent projectiles of SS109 and M855 cartridges from the category of primarily used for sporting purposes to that of armor piercing ammunition. The 17-page document was titled: ATF FRAMEWORK FOR DETERMINING WHETHER CERTAIN PROJECTILES ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR SPORTING PURPOSES WITHIN THE MEANING OF 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(17) and uploaded to ATF.gov , in part to enable interested parties to review it and submit comments before 16 March 2015. Article Continues Below The proposal cited the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-408, known as LEOPA) and referenced discussions with law enforcement agencies across the country about whether green tip ammunition could reasonably be construed an exempt form of sporting ammo under the 1986 guidelines.",1

According to Kerry, Commitment to Japans security remains ironclad and covers all territories under Japans administration, including the Senkaku islands. There has been some concern in Asia about whether the Obama administration would honor Americas defense treaties. This concern increased substantially after Obamas flip-flop on Syria, declaring that use of chemical weapons would be a game changer, and then backing off once Syrias president Bashar al-Assad killed hundreds of people with Sarin gas. After World War II, America signed a large number of mutual defense treaties with other countries. These include agreements with Japan, South Korea, Israel, Taiwan, the Philippines, the ANZUS agreement with Australia and New Zealand, a special treaty with Iceland, and the NATO agreement with all of Europe. Many people have questioned whether the administration would honor these mutual defense treaties during an actual attack. Kerrys statement was meant to reassure the Japanese. China has been claiming huge territories in the South China Sea and East China Sea that have historically belonged to other countries.",0
"Title: NYC MAYOR DE BLASIO Blasted by Queens WomanHe Runs Away! [Video]  Article: Vickie Paladino and her husband were driving through their neighborhood when they spotted the mayor. Paladino was so upset over de Blasios trip to Germany to speak at a G-20 protest in lieu of attending a vigil for slain New York police officer Miosotis Familia that she left the car to berate him. As de Blasio approached her and a group of others to shake hands, she started to ask about his trip. He turned around with his security detail and went to his car. I want to know why you let your police officers down and our country down by going to Germany and protesting against our country, she yelled at de Blasio. I want to know why youre doing that. OK? I dont care about the trees. Well work it out. CBS reporter Marcia Kramer had a scathing assessment of de Blasio, who she said simply fled when Paladino started her criticism. The woman in the white shirt single-handedly brought WrestleMania to the streets of Whitestone, Queens, but her opponent Bill de Blasio was no Hulk Hogan or The Rock, Kramer said. He was more like the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard Of Oz. Paladino caught the attention of the media assembled for the event, and she told reporters that shed had it with de Blasio and doubted he had a friend in the city. This is got to do with a liberal, socialist mayor who is running our city and has no regard for our country, she said. Why did you go to Germany?",1
"Title: Hows your Financial I.Q.? Take the test!  Article: Americas federal, state, and city governments are profligate and irresponsible with taxpayers money, over-spending themselves into declared and undeclared bankruptcy, and a national debt that now exceeds Americas GDP. But if we, the American people, are better managers of our own finances, not only would more of us realize the financial black hole government is in, we would also demand more fiscal prudence from officialdom. Alas, Hadley Malcolm reports for USA Today, April 24, 2012, that despite the recession, most Americans still know NOTHING about their finances, especially young people. Here are the facts: Americans in their 20s hold an average debt of about $45,000, which includes everything from cars to credit cards to student loans to mortgages, according to a PNC financial independence survey released last month. At the same time, Americans 18-29 year old have a much higher jobless rate of 12.4% , well above the national rate of 8.2%. Financial literacy is especially needed for young Americans because they face an increasingly complex global economy that is credit-driven and puts more responsibility on individuals to plan for and manage their retirement accounts. But too many young Americans are financial illiterates. A biennial survey by Jumpstart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy found that U.S. high school seniors scored an average of 57.3% on a 31-question financial literacy exam in 1997.",0

Would you like to share yours, as we do? (It looks pervasively evil and threatening, so far. ) From Euro-Med.DK, Sunday, September 26 (line breaks added) Summary: 140 heads of state and government have met at the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set up in 2000 to implement 8 global development goals by 2015  including halving poverty. Despite many fine words, obviously not much has been achieved, because poverty, hunger, lack of information, education and womens suppression, for example are deeply rooted in thousand-year-old traditions, especially Islam and corruption, rather than in lack of money, and because the western nations have realized this and the UNs ineptitude. The UN will not attack the underlying causes. Rather the UN is pursuing a classical communist ideology, grapping [grabbing] our money through secret taxes. Financial transactions and the harmless CO2 are the means to pass our money on to the IMF and World Bank (who loves its saviour, Al Gore) and who retain a great deal to themselves and throw a few dollars to poor countries, who cannot be helped anyway, because they are unable or unwilling to help themselves.The pretext is to help saving human lives. But now information emanates from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights that the UN Security Council and the latest 2 UN secretaries-general have been privy to Paul Kagames genocide of 5.4 million Rwandans since 1990  without having intervened or informed the world about it.

"Title: SYRIA: The White Helmets, Their Backers and Their Many Shades of Grey  Article: By Jan Oberg Transnational Foundation for Peace & Future Research While thousands of humanitarian organisations around the world are struggling fiercely with diminishing support from governments and the public, one has achieved a surprising amount of support from Western governments in a surprisingly short period of time and gained a surprising attention from mainstream media and ditto political elites: The Syrian Civil Defence or White Helmets. Their name of course makes you think of the UNs Blue Helmet and white is the colour of those who should be protected in harms way  and the colour of innocence. However, for many years there has been an Argentinian relief organisation with the same name. The SCD or White Helmets counts nearly 3.000 rescue workers who operate in very dangerous areas in rebel-held territories in Syria and claims that it has, in three years, rescued about 70.000 lives according to its Twitter account (or 65 per day). Contrary to what you might think, it isnt a Syrian organisation because Syria has its own organisation, incidentally also called Syria Civil Defence, which was established in 1953 and is registered with ICDO, the International Civil Defence Organisation, since 1972. The White Helmets seems to have an annual budget of US$$ 30 million and has raised a total support of well over US$$ 100 million. And it seems that they operate exclusively in war zones in which the fighting against the Syrian government and the Syrian Arab Army takes place, i.e.",0

Having considered materials of the case against Navalny and Pyotr Ofitserov, the court established that Navalny masterminded the embezzlement, judge Sergei Blinov said at the trial. Ofitserov was found guilty of assisting the embezzlement, the judge said. The Leninsky District Court of Kirov started to hear the criminal case on embezzlement from the Kirovles company on April 17. The prosecution claims that more than 10,000 cubic meters of timber was stolen from Kirovles between May and September 2009, inflicting damages of more than 16 million rubles on the Kirov region's administration. Navalny, who at that time served as an advisor to regional governor Nikita Belykh, is accused of organizing the alleged theft. Ofitserov, who headed Vyatka Timber Company, and Kirovles chief executive Vyacheslav Opalev were accused of complicity in the alleged embezzlement. Navalny is charged with ""organization of the embezzlement of an exceptionally large amount of property"". In December 2012 Opalev was given a suspended four-year sentence with a probation period of three years.",0
