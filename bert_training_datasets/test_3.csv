"Title: The cure for toxic masculinity is real masculinity  Article: This article was originally published on FEE.org. Read the original article. Since the #MeToo phenomenon hit, I have started asking my female friends directly about their everyday experiences with men. For example, what proportion of men that they meet on a dating app send utterly inappropriate communications, and how often in everyday life does a guy disrespect them in a way thats overtly or implicitly sexual? While I am sure that my circle of male friends isnt fully representative of the population of men at large, I was shocked to discover from my unscientific survey how many men have no clue about how to behave. Based on the combined responses of several women I trust, the number of men who say or do something offensive to a woman they dont know on a dating app, almost right out of the gate, may be just shy of a majority. And many a young woman can, if you ask her, relate tales of men making inappropriate remarks, shouting out of a car window as she walks down the street, whipping out his genitalia after one too many drinks, or being opportunistically crude at a coffee shop, even as she sits there with a very young child. (These were all stories I was told.) For some young women, these things seem to happen on a more or less monthly basis. My recent conversations with female friends about the matter has led me to this question: what the hell is wrong with these men, and why are there so many of them? What has happened to men? To me, this is not a question about sexual harassment. Its a more fundamental one: an old-fashioned idea called manners.",0
"Title: The Worlds First Space Nation Now Has A Satellite Flying Above The Earth  Article: The Worlds First Space Nation Now Has A Satellite Flying Above The Earth  November 16th, 2017  SHTFplan.com  Read by 3,948 people Mac SlavoNovember 16th, 2017 On November 12, Asgardia cemented its presence in outer space by launching the Asgardia-1 satellite. The nation is slowing coming to fruition. remain based on earth, for the time being, the satellite launch brings the nation one step closer to space. The nanosat is roughly the size of a loaf of bread and undertook a two-day journey from NASAs Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, the United States, to the International Space Station (ISS). It contains 0.5 TB of data belonging to 18,000 of Asgardias citizens, such as family photographs, as well as digital representations of the space nations flag, coat of arms, and constitution. While Asgardias citizens willremain based on earth, for the time being, the satellite launch brings the nation one step closer to space. Asgardia-1 made its journey to the ISS aboard the OA-8 Antares-Cygnus , a NASA commercial cargo vehicle. Now it must wait for about three weeks as vital supplies and scientific equipment are transferred from the NASA ship to the six people currently living at the ISS. The nanosat will then be detached from the NASA vehicle and begin its own orbital journey around the earth. Citizens data will remain in orbit for between five and 18 months, the typical lifespan of this type of satellite. It will then burn out and disappear. Russian scientist Dr. Igor Ashurbeyli founded the worlds first independent nation to operate in outer space in October 2016.",0
"Title: NSA Deleted Surveillance Data It Was Under Court Order To Maintain In Electronic Frontier Foundation Lawsuit  Article: And the hits of the Deep State just keep on coming! Apparently, the National Security Agency (NSA) admitted to US District Court Judge Jeffrey White on Thursday that they destroyed internet surveillance data that a court had ordered it to secure and maintain in a lawsuit brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. According to recent court filings, the NSA didn't take the necessary steps it told the court it would ensure the data was not destroyed. Politico reports:  Since 2007, the NSA has been under court orders to preserve data about certain of its surveillance efforts that came under legal attack following disclosures that President George W. Bush ordered warrantless wiretapping of international communications after the 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. In addition, the agency has made a series of representations in court over the years about how it is complying with its duties. However, the NSA told U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey White in a filing on Thursday night and another little-noticed submission last year that the agency did not preserve the content of internet communications intercepted between 2001 and 2007 under the program Bush ordered. To make matters worse, backup tapes that might have mitigated the failure were erased in 2009, 2011 and 2016, the NSA said. The NSA sincerely regrets its failure to prevent the deletion of this data, NSAs deputy director of capabilities, identified publicly as Elizabeth B., wrote in a declaration filed in October. NSA senior management is fully aware of this failure, and the Agency is committed to taking swift action to respond to the loss of this data.",1
"Title: Why One Doctor Believes A Killer Flu Pandemic Is Just Around The Corner  Article: Dr. Jonathan Quick, a medical doctor and one of the worlds top health professionals claims that the conditions are perfect for a new superbug in the form of a killer flu virus pandemic. Quick also believes that this pandemic could kill upwards of 33 million people in just 200 days. A piece written by Dr. Quick and published on The Daily Mail UKs website lays out why the doctor believes this pandemic is just around the corner. The big one is coming: a global virus pandemic that could kill 33 million victims in its first 200 days. Within the ensuing two years, more than 300 million people could perish worldwide. Dr. Jonathan Quick, The Daily Mail UK  Quick says one extreme scenario of a killer flu pandemic will fling the globe into financial chaos. If millions of people die because of the pandemic, there wont be enough survivors to run the computers or energy systems, leaving many to loot or die of starvation in the months following such a deadly outbreak. As a medical doctor and a health chief who has led global programmes at the World Health Organisation (WHO), I believe that the world is at risk of a viral pandemic that will be at least as deadly as anything we have ever known before. The most likely culprit will be a new and unprecedentedly deadly mutation of the influenza virus. The conditions are right. It could happen tomorrow. Dr. Jonathan Quick, The Daily Mail UK  A century after the Spanish Influenza outbreak which killed 100 million people, we are just as vulnerable to the flu now, says Dr. Qucik. But what about all those fancy vaccines? Doesnt that mean they dont work? Logic says yes but propaganda says no.",0
"Title: Anti-American Leftists Set To Expose Themselves At President Trump's First State Of The Union Speech  Article: The NWO neo-Nazi Left in Washington just cannot help themselves in identifying who they really are. During president Trump's first State of the Union speech in 2018, they will be showing us who the real anti-Americans are by either not showing up in protest, or by wearing black. The usual known psychos like Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, Al Green, John McCain, Frederica Wilson, John Lewis, Jeff Flake, and the list goes on, will either not be attending the SOTU or be wearing black. As many as 40 lawmakers have said they will not be attending the event at all. The benefit to American Patriots who believe in the sovereignty of the United States and the constitution as the basis of all law in the country, will be knowing who the people in office are who are busy trying to destroy their country. The usual protests against president Trump have already been arranged by some of these lawmakers to take place outside during the speech, which tells us basically that most of these lawmakers who are protesting against the President are either very close or actual members of the known terrorist groups BLM and ANTIFA. The DNC passed a resolution in 2015 supporting BLM and Hillary Clinton has funneled millions to BLM via various transactions from the Clinton Foundation. Since both BLM and ANTIFA have been labeled as terrorist organizations by the FBI and DHS, anyone who donates money to either of them is committing an act of treason against the US and should be arrested. The group BLM was the brainchild of Barack H Obama, thus it comes as no surprise that the Clinton's and most of the anti-American Left support it and or actually belong to it.",1

"Title: 2.8 Million Barrels Per Day: Activists Pull Off Huge Crude Oil Flow Shut-Down  Article: As a part of ongoing peaceful protests against the construction of new oil pipelines in the United States, protesters across four states halted the flow of crude from Canada by closing station valves. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has sued the US federal government to prevent construction of the 1,160-mile Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), claiming that tribal administration was not consulted, even though the pipeline runs through tribal lands. Thousands have rallied against the pipeline construction, and on Tuesday, protest group Climate Direct Action orchestrated a bold demonstration: cutting through fences surrounding remote flow stations in Washington, Montana, Minnesota, and North Dakota, activists shut down the southward flow of oil through multiple pipelines. ""We are acting in response to this catastrophe we are facing,"" said Afrin Sopariwala, a spokeswoman for the group. At least four individuals were arrested in relation to the stunt, which shut down pipelines belonging to Enbridge Inc., Spectra Energy, TransCanada, and Kinder Morgan.",0

"Title: SYRIA: The White Helmets, Their Backers and Their Many Shades of Grey  Article: By Jan Oberg Transnational Foundation for Peace & Future Research While thousands of humanitarian organisations around the world are struggling fiercely with diminishing support from governments and the public, one has achieved a surprising amount of support from Western governments in a surprisingly short period of time and gained a surprising attention from mainstream media and ditto political elites: The Syrian Civil Defence or White Helmets. Their name of course makes you think of the UNs Blue Helmet and white is the colour of those who should be protected in harms way  and the colour of innocence. However, for many years there has been an Argentinian relief organisation with the same name. The SCD or White Helmets counts nearly 3.000 rescue workers who operate in very dangerous areas in rebel-held territories in Syria and claims that it has, in three years, rescued about 70.000 lives according to its Twitter account (or 65 per day). Contrary to what you might think, it isnt a Syrian organisation because Syria has its own organisation, incidentally also called Syria Civil Defence, which was established in 1953 and is registered with ICDO, the International Civil Defence Organisation, since 1972. The White Helmets seems to have an annual budget of US$$ 30 million and has raised a total support of well over US$$ 100 million. And it seems that they operate exclusively in war zones in which the fighting against the Syrian government and the Syrian Arab Army takes place, i.e.",0
"Title: So now the corporate ed reformers are making a big movie about the ""parent trigger.""  Article: What the movie Waiting for Superman did for charter schools, a new movie called ""Won't Back Down"" hopes to do for the parent trigger movement. That is a national movement started by charter companies to organize parents to take over their schools. That is quite a risky business in my opinion since those groups of parents actually want to turn the public schools into charter schools. I fear it will cause a school to cave in to parents who are not educators, who are not informed as to effective teaching skills, and who might be using such an effort to avoid responsibility for their children as students. They are being manipulated by the billionaire education reformers. The cast and the backers: Is Education Reform Hollywood Box Office Gold? How far teachers have fallen since the Lean on Me days.Due to be released in September, Wont Back Down stars Viola Davis as a Pennsylvania teacher who joins with unexpected parent advocate Maggie Gyllenhaal in the push for a parent takeover of their school. Apparently the story hinges on so-call parent trigger laws, which allow parents to turn public schools into publicly funded charter schools if they can prove the teachers, administrators and curriculum are not serving the students. In real life, a handful of states have parent trigger laws on the books. To date, no trigger laws have turned a school over to parents, though today officials will decide whether to allow for just that at a desert school in Adelanto, Calif. Parent trigger laws have many big corporate backers, including the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation.",0
"Title: The Young and the Stupid  Article: Oh, the virtue-signaling was hot and heavy as conservative and ostensibly libertarian media outlets competed to see who come up with the most self-righteously abusive rhetoric to describe North Korean Politburo member Kim Yo Yong, sister to Kim Jong Un. BuzzFeed grabbed the prize with a garbage monster  BuzzFeed being an expert when it comes to garbage. Reasons Nick Gillespie could hardly contain his joy at the fusillade of hatred: It was younger media outlets and personalities such as Buzzfeed and CNNs Jake Tapper that called bullshit on such stories. In Gillespies world, young is a synonym for good, because the young and the stupid will inherit the earth. Tapper is one of the War Partys most fulsome cheerleaders, and BuzzFeeds working relationship with the US State Department during the Obama administration was pretty brazen: but if Gillespie means young and dumb, or young and bought off, then perhaps hes right. If you hate US leaders more than you hate the Kim Jong-un regime, tweeted Tapper the tool, you really need to read up on North Korea and he helpfully supplied a link to Human Rights Watchs analysis of North Korea. Hatred of foreign bogeymen is what Tapper, Gillespie, and all those no-longer-quite-so-young media mavens deal in: were supposed to hate Kim Yo Yong, those North Korean cheerleaders, and anyone who isnt in a tizzy about North Korean propaganda supposedly broadcast by the media. Because, you see, simply showing a smiling and attractive Kim Yo Yong next to the dour and ill-at-ease Mike Pence is perversely fawning over the former.",1
"Title: Rasmussen Poll: Trump's Approval Rating Among Black Voters Now 29% vs. 15% One Year Ago  Article: New Rasmussen poll results point to an increase in President Trump's approval among black voters to 29% from 15% one year ago. And it would not take a huge shift in black voter sentiment to sway an election. If the results of this poll, a near doubling of support in one year, are genuine and sustainable, Democrats have reason to worry. Although this news may sound surprising, there are valid reasons for blacks to gravitate toward Trump. Democratic candidates generally take black support for granted, but Trump has actually made an effort to reach out to the black community. #ICYMI: From yesterday: Todays @realDonaldTrump approval ratings among black voters: 29% take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

"Title: Black pro-life leaders head to Selma, Alabama to expose illegal abortion clinic  Article: OpinionAbortion June 10, 2015 (Bound4Life) -- Bloody Sunday is a moment forever etched in the history of the civil rights movement in America. What should have been a peaceful march for the rights of blacks to vote without hindrance became a gruesome scene of police brutality on display. The images of police battering protestors on Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama gave the world a picture of the high price people would pay for human rights. With the widespread popularity of the Oscar-winning film Selma, those key events in this small Alabama town have become all the more iconic in our culture. On June 19 and 20, 2015, pro-life leaders from across the country will gather in Selma, Alabama to march over Edmund Pettus Bridge in protest of the greatest injustice facing black Americans today. Catherine Davis, President of the Restoration Project, is leading efforts to bring national attention to the harmful activity of Central Alabama Womens Clinic. Run by abortion doctor Samuel G. Lett, the clinic is operating illegally as an abortion clinic. Under section 420-5-1-.01 (e) of Alabama regulations, medical facilities that do more than nine abortions per month must be licensed as an abortion facility. According to news reports, an investigation by Life Legal Defense Foundation, CEC for Life and Operation Rescue revealed through documented phone calls that the Central Alabama Womens Clinic is doing more abortions than the law allows for a medical facility. Statistics show that black women have the highest abortion rates of any race in our country.",0
"Title: Iran as Terror Myth  Article: https://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/iran-terror-myth/  According to the U.S. Department of State, Iran foments terrorism: Designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1984, Iran continued its terrorist-related activity in 2016  The Department of State does its best to create an imaginary, unreal, nonexistent, mythical image of Iran as terror haven. This is false. If this were true, State could list the terror incidents on American soil that Iran sponsored. They do not, because they cannot. If there were such a list showing the guilt of Iran in causing terrorist acts in America, the U.S. would long ago have declared war on Iran. The closest Washington can come to blaming Iran for a terror event in America is the incident involving the plan to assassinate the Saudi ambassador. The participation of Irans government in that affair is highly contested. We keep getting mass murder attacks on American soil, some of which are terror attacks. List one is here. List two is here. List three, a shorter list that focuses only on radical Islamist attacks during Obamas 8 years, is here. How many of these attacks trace back to Iran? NONE. ZERO. None of the 13 attacks in List 3 are even remotely linked to Iran. List 1 doesnt supply enough data to determine affiliations of terrorists without further research. List 2 is a long Wiki list. Not a single instance of links of a terrorist to Iran occurs among the incidents listed. One case involves an Iranian-American: Although Taheri-azar was born in Tehran, the capital of Iran, he is a naturalized U.S. citizen who moved to the United States at the age of two. He had absolutely no connection to Iran.",0
"Title: Muslim Candidate for Governor Comes Unhinged Over Sharia  Article: Michigan's first-ever Muslim candidate for governor, Dr. Abdul al-Sayed, took a shot at fellow gubernatorial candidate Patrick Colbeck on Thursday that some Republicans are saying was below the belt. Colbeck, speaking at a candidate's forum in East Lansing, expressed his concerns about Sharia law and the extremist Muslim Brotherhood's tactic of civilization jihad. Colbeck took exception with an article he says was planted last month by Sayed supporters at the left-wing website Buzzfeed, which painted Colbeck as a fringe extremist using ""unfounded conspiracy theories"" against Sayed. Rather than address Colbeck's concerns about the Brotherhood, Sayed called Colbeck a racist Islamophobe whom Muslims ""definitely hate."" Sayed, 33, the former public-health director for the city of Detroit, was on stage Thursday evening at the Michigan Press Association with several other Democrat and Republican candidates for governor running in the Aug. 7 primary. Sayed refused to answer a question from the moderator about the Islamic legal system known as Sharia, other than to say that, if elected, he would uphold the constitutions of the U.S. and State of Michigan. ""I take [the Constitution] particularly seriously because it guarantees me two things. A, the right to pray as I choose to pray, and for me that means I put my face on the ground 34 times a day,"" Sayed said. ""Some people choose not to pray at all. Then in Article Six it also tells us that no religious test should be held over someone wishing to serve under this Constitution. It's an incredible document.""",1
"Title: Mexico now exports more cars to the U.S. than Japan does  Article: Mexicos booming auto industry has reached a major milestone, claiming to have overtaken Japan as the second biggest car exporter to the United States in the past three months. The Latin American nation now only trails Canada, but experts say Mexico could become the top exporter to its northern neighbor as soon as 2015, a potent symbol of its growing global clout in the sector. Industry analysts had expected Mexico to surpass Japan by the end of the year, but the Mexican Automobile Industry Association (AMIA) says it has happened faster than expected. It does not surprise me that they did (overtake Japan), and that number will even get bigger, Haig Stoddard, industry analyst at Michigan-based WardsAuto Group, told AFP. The figure came in an AMIA report this week showing record production in the first quarter, with 774,731 units rolling out of plants in Mexico, a 6.5 percent increase from the same period last year. AMIA, using its own statistics and WardsAuto figures, said the United States imported 428,376 Made in Mexico cars compared to 408,405 from Japan between January and March.",0
"Title: More Muslim Faked Hate: 11-Year-Old Muslima Lied About About Being Attacked For Wearing Hijab  Article: Another worldwide brouhaha over a Muslim hate crime and then the subsequent media after it is exposed as a faked incident by a Muslim. The majority of hate crimes against Muslims are committed or faked by Muslims in order to give some evidence of the big lie of Islamophobia. UPDATE: Reported attack 'did not happen': Police say UPDATE: Police now say the reported attack on an 11-year-old girl wearing a hijab ""described in the original news release did not happen."" Full details: www.cbc.ca/1.4487716 Posted by CBC Toronto on Friday, January 12, 2018  Before this hate crime was even vetted, the increasingly unfit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau exploited it to further the imposition of sharia in Canada. He has yet to make a comment. Attacks on Jews are double the attacks on Muslims in Canada, and Trudeau never said a word. An assailant, in two attempts within 10 minutes, cut the girls hijab using scissors while she was walking to school with her brother on Friday, a Toronto police spokeswoman said. I felt confused, scared, terrified, Khawlah Noman, who is in Grade 6, told reporters at her school on Friday. I screamed. The man just ran away. We followed this crowd of people to be safe. He came again. He continued cutting my hijab again. What a vicious liar. These lies and smears against non-Muslims are encouraged by a media and political elite that richly rewards such claims. Reporting a hate crime that is faked should be a criminal offense. How many people were harassed and interrogated by the police as a result of this hate crime?",1

According to Kerry, Commitment to Japans security remains ironclad and covers all territories under Japans administration, including the Senkaku islands. There has been some concern in Asia about whether the Obama administration would honor Americas defense treaties. This concern increased substantially after Obamas flip-flop on Syria, declaring that use of chemical weapons would be a game changer, and then backing off once Syrias president Bashar al-Assad killed hundreds of people with Sarin gas. After World War II, America signed a large number of mutual defense treaties with other countries. These include agreements with Japan, South Korea, Israel, Taiwan, the Philippines, the ANZUS agreement with Australia and New Zealand, a special treaty with Iceland, and the NATO agreement with all of Europe. Many people have questioned whether the administration would honor these mutual defense treaties during an actual attack. Kerrys statement was meant to reassure the Japanese. China has been claiming huge territories in the South China Sea and East China Sea that have historically belonged to other countries.",0
"Title: Canadian Police State vs. Brad Love  Article: By Paul Fromm TORONTO, CanadaThe decade-long saga of state persecution of inveterate Canadian letter-writer Brad Love reached a new low November 28 when he was criminally charged for writing a letter to his own lawyer. While many of his fellow prisoners were passing the time watching TV or semi-comatose on the medications freely ladled out by the authorities, Love prefers to read and write. But Americas neighbor to the north cant have that. Its better to be a compliant zombie than a dissident thinker in politically-correct Canada. Loves incoming mail was held up for more than a month, and he has been informed he is not allowed to write to anyone. Years after his conviction in 2002 under Canadas notorious hate law for writing non-threatening letters to public officials criticizing Canadas immigration mess, Love is still mired in the toils of repression. In March 2009, Love was arrested by eight armed detectives at a Toronto free speech meeting for sending some information packages to four Toronto Jewish groups. In July 2012, after 10 court appearances, requiring travel from Alberta, time off work and loss of wages, Love was sentenced to a further 18 months in prison, plus a further three-year gag order from writing letters to the media or politicians. He has called his ordeal an abuse by process. He has applied for bail, pending an appeal. In July 2013, his bail was arbitrarily revoked, so for the past five months he has languished in jail, again for nothing more than the non-violent expression of his populist, no-nonsense, working-guy views. Love had been employed in a lucrative job in Albertas tar sands in Fort McMurray.",0

After visiting Las Vegas and several of the victims of the shooting, Trump said that Americans would remember the victims by living lives full of purpose, with hearts full of love, and with hope for a better tomorrow. ""On Wednesday, I traveled to Las Vegas to visit with the victims of the horrific shooting, speak with their families, and thank the brave citizens, first responders and medical personnel who saved so many lives,"" Trump said. ""We struggle to grasp the evil that occurred on Sunday evening when a murderer shot into a crowd of more than 20,000 people. Men, women, and children were gathered to enjoy a concert. They never imagined it would become the worst day of their lives."" ""But in the wake of such shock and horror, it was a matter of seconds before the goodness of the human spirit broke through,"" he added. ""When the shooting began, a mother laid on top of her daughter to shield her from gunfire. A husband died to protect his beloved wife. Strangers rescued strangers, police officers and first responders rushed into danger."" ""When the worst of humanity strikes, the best of humanity responds."" ""The men and women who risked their lives to save their fellow citizens give proof to the words of this Scripture: 'The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it,' Trump continued.

Diana Capra, the school district's chief of communications and community engagement, said in a statement: ""The teacher was not penalized or placed on leave based on her viewpoints. ...The district can clarify that the action was taken due to complaints from parents and students involving the teacher's communications regarding... the student-led remembrance activities."" Right, so, it appears that Breitbart's Senior Editor-at-large Joel Pollack was right. The schools are siding with political agendas. They are siding with parents and students who may support the murder of the unborn while trying to disarm the American people, but they cannot stand by their teacher for asking a simple question as to whether or not those students who support life can also perform the same type of protest as the anti-Second Amendment students. ""[If schools] are going to allow one group of students to get up during class and walk out to protest one issue, would they still give the same courtesy to another group of students who wanted to get up and walk out to protest? And I used the example of abortion,"" Benzel told ""Fox and Friends."" Benzel said that she had to take a ""mental health"" day after being asked to return to work on Friday. However, she seems intent on returning on Monday.",1
"Title: This Ancient Babylonian Star Map Of Jupiter Just Changed History  Article: A researcher has just deciphered a mysterious clay tablet from ancient Babylon and it has changed history forever. After close study, researchers concluded that ancient Babylonian Astronomers were able to calculate the precise celestial movements of Jupiter with the help of an ancient form of geometric calculus, which, according to mainstream scholars, wasnt invented over millennia after. Mainstream scholars had maintained for quite some time now that this type of math was by the Europeans over 1500 years later. The ancient Babylonian tablet was translated by Astro archaeologist Matthieu Ossendrijver of Humbolt University in Berlin. As Science Alert reports: This means that these ancient Mesopotamian astronomers had not only figured out how to predict Jupiters paths more than 1,000 years before the first telescopes existed, but they were using mathematical techniques that would form the foundations of modern calculus as we now know it. The discovery is a groundbreaking one, since the tablet belongs to a group of hundreds of other tablets that were excavated during the 19th century, and researchers all around the globe have been working for over one hundred ears, trying to decode them all. Researchers believe that the clay tablets date back to around 100 or 200 BC. The tablets are the ultimate piece of evidence which suggests that ancient astronomers had the knowledge and ability to calculate both speed and distance of celestial objects. The tablet proves that ancient Babylonian astronomers were tracing Jupiter in the sky in a specific amount of time.",0
"Title: Treason, #Arkancide bloat the Clinton fortune, invalidate presidential bid  Article: Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE Quit complaining and vote Treason, #Arkancide bloat the Clinton fortune, invalidate presidential bid Inflammatory headline? Perhaps. At least until the facts are considered on their merits and not on the general medias sugarcoating. One of the greatest hurdles American voters are confronting is media avoiding the landmines of the democrat nominees fringe criminality and outright lawbreaking by focusing attention on the myth of a strong Obama economy and Hillary Clintons support of these policies. Its time to drop the pretense that democrats work to make life better for the less fortunate. The opposite has been borne out by decades of failed assistance programsfrom the Great Society (re-invented New Deal), to expanding tentacles into public education, welfare, housing, environment, healthcare (Affordable Care Act) and infrastructure (Stimulus), ad infinitumthat have plunged cities into virtual prisons of poverty. Refuting the words of hope and change is the dismal truth of back-slapping power brokering that has made politicians like the Clintons and Obamas enormously wealthy for doing not only nothing, but reversing the growth potential of average citizens by tying their hands with miles of regulating red tape. Under other circumstances, the Clintons and Obamas would be cardinal examples of how someone can rise from mediocre beginnings to find success in the world. (Mediocre is purposefully used rather than the expected modest.) Consider how the Clintons climbed the political ladder by latching onto elitist racist socialists during their college years.",1
"Title: Trump's Pick for CIA Chief Backs Jailing Snowden, May Lead to Death Penalty  Article: US President Barack Obama has stated that he cant pardon NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, a claim that is not entirely true. The incoming administration takes an even tougher stance: execute him. Earlier this week, Obama said in an online interview with the German media outlet Der Spiegel that he ""can't pardon somebody who hasn't gone before a court and presented themselves. ""  AFP 2018/ Glen CHAPMAN Obama: Pardon for Snowden Couldnt Be Contemplated Until US Court Appearance However, there are apparently no legislative restrictions on a presidential pardon. According to a Supreme Court ruling from 1886, ""The power of pardon conferred by the Constitution upon the President is unlimited except in cases of impeachment. It extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment. The power is not subject to legislative control. "" As P.S. Ruckman, editor of the Pardon Power blog, put it, ""I just think what he may have better said is: I prefer that he present himself to a court and then we'll talk turkey.' But technically in terms of the Constitution, there are no restrictions at all. "" Mike Pompeo, President-Elect Donald Trump's pick for CIA director takes a draconian position on the issue.",0
"Title: Islam and secularism want to monopolize the public square. Heres why thats concerning  Article: OpinionFreedom, Politics - World January 9, 2018 (Turning Point Project)  Secularists like to advise Christians that, for the sake of social harmony, they ought to keep their religion to themselves. Religion, they argue, is a private affair between an individual and his designated deity, and ought not to be dragged into the public square. Moreover, they helpfully add, its an imposition on others to confront them with beliefs that they may find offensive. As for themselves, secularists have no qualms about imposing their own values on everyone within reach. They are convinced of the rightness of their beliefs, and consequently they dont think twice about forcing Christian bakers, florists, and photographers to endorse gay weddings. They are also convinced that they know whats best for your children. And whats best for them, they are quite certain, is that they learn all the latest fashions in gender identity and marriage equality. In his groundbreaking 1984 book, The Naked Public Square, Richard John Neuhaus argued that the public square can never be naked for long. In other words, it cannot be neutral about values: If it is not clothed with the meanings borne by religion, new meanings will be imposed by virtue of the ambitions of the modern state. In short, the committed secularist wont be satisfied with the removal of the crche from the town square. Hell insist that it be replaced with something that more accurately reflects American diversitysay, a monument to Margaret Sanger or a statue of James Obergefell. Of course, secular societys reach extends well beyond the town green.",1
"Title: PLO Terrorists Won't Let Us Mediate, Will Take Our $$$  Article: Bad news. The Islamic terrorist group we fund won't let us mediate the non-existent peace process that they've rejected and walked away from every time and under every previous president. I don't know what we'll do now. But it'll probably involve giving them more money (thanks to everyone who neutered the Taylor Force Act) and trying to negotiate an impossible peace with them anyway. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told an international summit Wednesday that the United States was unfit to mediate the Mideast conflict, marking a major policy shift after decades spent courting American goodwill. But there is a role for the US in giving Abbas hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Sometimes the PLO reminds me of a murderous brat. ""I'm not gonna talk to you dad, but you still have to pay for everything."" I have a modest proposal. It involves not funding terrorists. Especially snotty terrorists. Abbas said Trumps decision was a crime, which came at a time when the Palestinians were engaged with Washington in a new push to reach a long-elusive peace agreement with Israel, the deal of our times. Instead we got the slap of our times, Abbas said. The United States has chosen to lose its qualification as a mediator ... We will no longer accept that it has a role in the political process. He suggested the U.N. should take over as mediator. That sounds like a plan. The UN and the PLO should mediate negotiations over which of them hates Jews more. The summit of the 57-member Organization of Muslim Cooperation concluded with the so-called Istanbul Declaration, outlining the blocs response to Trumps declaration.",0
"Title: Northern Irelands health minister resigns after backlash over remarks criticizing gay parenting  Article: NewsHomosexuality, Politics - World April 30, 2015 (LifeSiteNews.com)  Northern Irelands health minister has resigned after facing backlash on social media for speaking negatively about homosexual parenting. Jim Wells, an MLA with the Democratic Unionist Party, said in a statement that he and his family have been subjected to nasty, threatening, and abusive condemnation, even though he publicly apologized for having suggested that children are more likely to be abused in unstable homosexual relationships. Irish media reported that Wells said ""facts show you certainly dont bring a child up in a homosexual relationship, that a child is far more likely to be abused and neglected,"" during an election campaign stop in South Down on April 23. ""On the issue of comments I have made which have attracted significant publicity, I have already said sorry for the offence caused and acknowledged that the comments were factually inaccurate. At no time did I set out to hurt or offend anyone and it has upset me greatly that the comments made have cause distress to some within our community,"" Wells said in the statement. I am deeply saddened that some of those who represent a different viewpoint from me have attacked my family and me in a deeply personal, nasty and, in some cases, threatening way. Some of the outbursts on social media have been particularly abusive and menacing in nature, he stated. Notwithstanding Wells' admission of factual inaccuracy in his apology, many children raised by same-sex couples maintain that their lives were nothing short of disasters.

"Title: Retired bishop reposts scathing commentary on Boston gay pride Mass (corrected)  Article: NewsFaith, Homosexuality This article has been CORRECTED to name Joe Sacerdo as the author of the original commentary, not Bishop Gracida, who had reposted the commentary on his blog. We sincerely apologize for the error. CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas, June 22, 2011 (LifeSiteNews.com) - Corpus Christis outspokenly conservative retired Catholic bishop has re-posted a strong commentary against the scandal surrounding Bostons gay pride Mass scheduled for next month, in which the author calls it a travesty that the archdiocese would countenance the event. Bishop Ren Henry Gracida on his blog Tuesday posted an article by pseudonymous blogger Joe Sacerdo, of the conservative Catholic blog Bryan Hehir Exposed, discussing the event originally planned by the Rainbow Ministry of St. Cecilias Parish to coincide with Bostons gay pride month, before it was cancelled by the Archdiocese of Boston. Gay rights supporters in the parish were only partially mollified when the archdiocese clarified that the Mass, themed All Are Welcome, was being rescheduled for July 10. The diocese had said it was worried that the original date gave the unintended impression that the Mass was meant to celebrate gay pride month. However, the original statement in the church bulletin announcing the Mass had explicitly invited all friends and supporters of the LGBT community to a Mass in celebration of Bostons Pride Month. Echoing the sentiments of local pro-family Catholic leaders, Sacerdo concluded, Its pretty bad in Boston. So, unless Im mistaken, Cardinal Sean OMalley, Bishop Robert Hennessey, [archdiocesan spokesman] Terry Donilon, Fr.",0
"Title: Young men giving up on marriage: Women arent women anymore  Article: NewsFamily Fewer young men in the US want to get married than ever, while the desire for marriage is rising among young women, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew recently found that the number of women 18-34 saying that having a successful marriage is one of the most important things rose from 28 percent to 37 percent since 1997. The number of young adult men saying the same thing dropped from 35 percent to 29 percent in the same time. Pews findings have caught the attention of one US writer who maintains that feminism, deeply entrenched in every segment of the culture, has created an environment in which young men find it more beneficial to simply opt out of couple-dom entirely. Suzanne Venkers article, The War on Men, which appeared on the website of Fox News in late November, has become a lodestone for feminist writers who have attacked her position that the institution of marriage is threatened, not enhanced, by the supposed gains of the feminist movement over the last 50 years. Where have all the good (meaning marriageable) men gone? is a question much talked about lately in the secular media, Venker says, but her answer, backed up by statistics, is not to the liking of mainstream commentators influenced by feminism. STORY: My father raped his daughter. And I am their baby. My story. She points out that for the first time in US history, the number of women in the workforce has surpassed the number of men, while more women than men are acquiring university degrees. The problem? This new phenomenon has changed the dance between men and women, Venker wrote.",1
"Title: The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody  Article: dissidentvoice.org By Bill Annett In his final speech to the American people on January 17, 1961, just two days before the Kennedy inauguration, President Dwight Eisenhower warned the nation of the danger presented by what he called the military-industrial complex . In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist. Today, the disastrous rise of misplaced power not only persists, but has grown exponentially. Today, we are governed not by the people, not merely by a military-industrial complex, but by a troika of military and corporate monoliths and a subservient government, operating as a triumvirate, the extent of which Eisenhower could not have imagined. To the dangerous military-industrial partnership or conspiracy that Ike warned against, there has now been added a third and more tragic dimension  the outright proselytizing of government members by corporate buy-out  which is at the root of a seemingly unstoppable juggernaut that threatens to neuter and dismember the nation as we know it.",0
"Title: Alternative for Germany Party Member Arthur Wagner Converts To Islam  Article: Arthur Wagner, a member of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party that opposes Angela Merkels suicidal influx of Muslim migrants, recently gained headlines (as well as crowing and accolades from all the usual infiltrators, saboteurs, and dhimmis) by converting to Islam. But then he revealed why he had answered the call of Allah. It was, he said, all about the Christian Churches moral decline. One of the reasons, Wagner explained, is tied to changes that have taken place in the church, which no longer reflects my values. He said that it was unacceptable for Christian leaders to support marriage for all and to participate in gay pride parades, where there are children. Excoriating the Protestant churchs moral decline is one thing, but now Wagner has joined a religion that teaches that homosexuals must be put to death. The Quran contains numerous condemnations of homosexual activity: And Lot when he said to his people, Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people.And We rained upon them a rain of stones. Then see how was the end of the criminals. (Quran 7:80-84)  Muhammad specifies the punishment for this in a hadith: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, Whoever you find doing the action of the people of Loot, execute the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.

"Title: Brazils Bolsonaro Shows Majority-Minority US May Not Work Out Quite How Left Hopes | Articles  Article: See, earlier: Brazils BolsonaroAmong Other Things, A Pentecostalist Triumph? We constantly hear the Dem/ Main Stream Media Complex gloating that the US will be a majority non-white country by the 2040s. This prediction makes white Democrats hopeful as they naively envision a rainbow future of equality, love and electoral hegemony. It makes white Republicans despondent, as they see it as a harbinger of permanent Leftist rule and the destruction of the America they knew and cherished [Study: overhyped media narratives about Americas fading white majority fuel anxiety, By Matthew Yglesias, Vox, May 2, 2018]. But the election of Jair Bolsonaro as president of Brazil shows that even when whites are a minorityin Brazil they constitute just 47% of the populationpeople who value the future of the country can still win. There is little question that becoming majority-minority will be bad for the US. The more ethnically diverse a society is the more conflict there is (see Ethnic Conflicts, by Tatu Vanhanen) and the less white (or Northeast Asian) it is, the less intelligent it is, meaning chaos, corruption, and out-of-control crime (see Intelligence: A Unifying Construct for the Social Sciences, by Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen).

"Title: Russia Blocks Investigation of Syrian Chemical Weapons  Article: The mandate of an international expert panel investigating use of chemical weapons in Syria, known as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), has expired. JIM was established by the United Nations Security Council, unanimously, in 2015 to identify to the greatest extent feasible individuals, entities, groups or governments perpetrating, organizing, sponsoring or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals as weapons in Syria. With its mandate about to come to an end if not renewed by another Security Council resolution, Russia killed it with two vetoes late last week. That brings to 11 the number of times that Russia has moved to block a Security Council resolution dealing with Syria since the conflict broke out there six years ago. The original draft resolution submitted by the United States would have extended the Joint Investigative Mechanisms mandate by a year and affirmed the methodological and evidentiary standards employed in JIMs investigations. Russia would have none of that, however. It sought to discredit the JIM panel after it released its report on October 26, 2017 finding that the Syrian regime had been responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Shaykhun on April 4, 2017. The panel had also found that ISIS was responsible for the use of sulfur mustard at Umm Hawsh in September 2016. In order to protect its ally in the future against anything that smacked of accountability for its brutality, Russia vetoed the U.S. draft resolution. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley was unsparing in her criticism of Russias obstructionism following Russias veto of the U.S.-sponsored draft resolution.",1
"Title: Racists Use Wireless Networks To Propagate Hatred  Article: By Ray Charlston Racists around the world have discovered a new way of promoting hatred. Following the recommendations of Edward Thompson, an online blogger, racists have begun re-naming their wireless networks Race Realist or Race Realism in an attempt to intimidate minorities and spread their intolerant views. Authorities are currently investigating whether this action constitutes hate-speech, which is illegal in most of Europe but not in the US yet. For those who do not know, a wireless network refers to a computer network. In this case, one operating from an individuals home or business which provides wireless internet access for him or her, often for a family, or an office. For some time now, individuals have been able to select a name or designation of their choice for their wireless network. Computers in the vicinity of a wireless network will often automatically detect it, listing the name of a local network or networks. On his very offensive, racist, sexist, and homophobic blog, Edward Thompson states that his purpose is to Spread an awareness of Race Realism. He states that when a computer detects the wireless network, and people see the name Race Realist it may spike their curiosity or interest. They may do an internet search to find out more information. Its great free publicity that costs nothing more than ones existing internet service subscription. Thompson, while claiming that Race Realist is his favourite wireless network name, also suggests that racist individuals might alternate between names or vary them in order to reach neighbours or others in their vicinity with multiple offensive concepts.",1
"Title: Obama and Trudeau Seizing The Oceans  Article: It is an irrefutable truth that the UN stole Gods gift to mankind before sanctimoniously calling it the Law of the Sea Treaty. It was the wisdom and majesty of God Almighty that gave us the treasures of Earths oceans. And in their incomparable greed and self-vested power, it was the unelected bureaucrats at the United Nations who seized them when no one but the politicians of the day were looking. The treaty also creates an International Seabed Authority with the power to levy a $250,000 tax (application fee) on anyone who wishes to explore the seabed. It would also tax (royalties) everything that might be excavated from the seabed. It requires technology transfer from the nations that have technology to the nations that dont  under the supervision of the U.N., of course. A more thorough analysis of the treaty is available online. Not only would this treaty give the U.N. jurisdiction over the open seas  70 percent of the Earths surface  it would require that U.S. sovereignty over U.S. territorial seas be exercised  subject to this Convention and other rules of international law. Outrageous! And this is one of the least offensive provisions. Of all the so-called environmental treaties that have come down the pike in recent years, none is as comprehensive or as important to the creation of global governance as the Law of the Sea Treaty.",1

"Title: U.S Scrambles Jets as Tensions Threaten to Explode in Syria, Ukraine, S. China Sea  Article: As of late, with so many military actions and airstrikes occurring, it almost appears as if we could be seeing the beginning steps of the predicted WWIII. Russian airstrikes are taking place in rebel-controlled parts of Aleppo in the northwestern regions of Syria. As this is occurring we watched as the United States rushed to protect coalition forces from Syrian fighter jets in the northeastern Village known as Hasaka. A city in northeastern Syria has become a flash-point in the countrys civil war as Syrian warplanes attack Kurdish forces Thursday, reports VOA, and the United States responded by sending in its own aircraft to protect U.S. coalition forces in the area. However, according to the Pentagon, Russia states they take no responsibility for the strikes, and in regards to Russia, we made clear that coalition aircraft would defend its troops on the ground it threatened. With the spotlight shining on Russia as of lately, as it recently was revealed that Russia was using an Iranian air base to launch strikes in Aleppo, which would highlight a cooperative military tie between the two countries. Taking this information into consideration, TIME even claimed that there could be a new axis of evil taking place between Russia, Syria, and Iran. Since this information was brought to light, Russia claims they have discontinued use of the Iranian air base. While the story was breaking about U.S jets scrambling in Northeastern Syria, Japan announced that it was seeking a massive upgrade to its F-15 fighters that could double their payload capacity.",1
"Title: Two State Dissolution: Hamas Blamed for PLO PM Assassination Plot  Article: That ""Two State Solution"" that is an article of faith from AIPAC to the DNC is certainly doing well. Not just the Israel-PLO Solution, but dividing PLO territory up between Hamas and the PLO. Here's the latest report about what those crazy terrorist kids have been up to. Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah survived an assassination attempt in northern Gaza on Tuesday morning, according to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency. Hamdallah, who was making a short trip to the coastal enclave to mark the opening of a new water treatment facility, had just passed through the Erez border crossing from Israel when a bomb detonated near his convoy, tearing the siding off at least one black SUV and blowing out the car's windows. No one was injured in the attack, said Iyad Al-Bozom, spokesman for the Palestinian Ministry of Interior and National Security, in a Facebook post. Palestinian Authority Minister of Intelligence Majid Faraj, a close ally of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbbas, was also in the convoy. In a sign of longstanding animosity between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, Fatah -- which governs the West Bank and controls the Palestinian Authority -- immediately blamed the Islamist movement in Gaza for the attack. Before trying to bring peace between Israel and the Islamic colonial terrorists, maybe they should make peace between the rival terrorist groups? If they can't get along with each other, how are they supposed to get along with the hated Jews? Hamdallah is making his third visit to Gaza following the beginning of reconciliation efforts between the Authority and Hamas late last year.",1
"Title: Patrick J. Buchanan: Trump's Historic Gamble In North Korea | Articles  Article: Earlier by Pat Buchanan: A Trump Doctrine for Singapore and Beyond  President Donald Trump appears to belong to what might be called the Benjamin Disraeli school of diplomacy. The British prime minister once counseled, ""Everyone likes flattery; and when you come to Royalty you should lay it on with a trowel."" At his Singapore summit, Trump smartly saluted a North Korean general and then lavished praise on Kim Jong Un as a ""strong guy"" with a ""good personality"" and a ""great negotiator."" ""He's funny, and ... very, very smart ... and a very strategic kind of a guy. ... His country does love him."" Predictably, Trump is being scourged for this. Yet, during his trip to Peking in 1972, Richard Nixon did not confront Chairman Mao on his history of massacres and murder, though Nixon's visit came in the midst of Mao's Cultural Revolution, a nationwide pogrom. Nor did Churchill or FDR at their wartime summits confront their ally Stalin for his legendary crimes against humanity. Both gushed over ""Uncle Joe."" Still, if the Trump-Kim camaraderie goes south and the crisis of 2017, when war seemed possible, returns, Trump, as he concedes, will be charged with naivety for having placed his trust in such a tyrant. Yet, to Trump's credit, we are surely at a better place than we were a year ago when Kim was testing hydrogen bombs and ICBMs, and he and Trump were trading threats and insults in what seemed the prelude to a new Korean War. Whatever one may think of his diplomacy, Trump has, for now, lifted the specter of nuclear war from the Korean peninsula and begun a negotiating process that could lead to tolerable coexistence.",0
"Title: Dont Believe Our Planet is Warming Up? Look At This!  Article: Many people, for some reason, refuse to believe that climate change is a real thing. With evidence mounting, we all need to get on the same page. Meteorologists in England began collecting weather statistics back in 1659 but it wasnt until 1873 that countries began sharing annual data through what is now known as the World Meteorological Organization. This is why officially the global record doesnt begin until 1880. The year 2016 was our hottest year since we began recording with average global land and water surface temperatures hitting 58.69 degrees Fahrenheit. That is around 2.69 degrees warmer than the twentieths century average. All but one of the sixteen hottest years in NASAs 134-year record have occurred since the year 2000. While this difference may not seem like much to most but it is. Records show that changes of this magnitude do not happen over a mere century leaving human fingerprints all over the temperature trend. Industry, as you know, boomed in the late 1800s sending new pollutants into the air. As a result of this carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have multiplied and are continuing to do so even today. Global warming is like riding up an escalator. Sure, these temperatures rise and fall but climate change is pushing the skyward no matter what. In the chart below you will see the numbers of years per decade that had above average temperature and how many of those years rose a half or whole degree above what was normal. You do not need a science degree to see that the average global temperature is rising. Our hottest years are getting hotter and something needs to be done.",0

"Title: George W. Bush Ordered to Testify Under Oath  Article: Link to AP article Gary Vodicka, a lawyer who lived in a condominium complex across the street from Southern Methodist University, has sued the university regarding how it obtained the land where the Bush library will be - where his home once stood. The lawsuit centers on SMU's acquisition of University Gardens, a run-down, 40-year-old condominium complex across the street from the university. SMU decided at the end of 1998 to begin buying up the approximately 350 units. Through a realty company called Peruna  the name of the college's mascot  SMU bought enough units to gain a majority of seats on the board of the homeowners association. It filled those seats with SMU employees and others affiliated with the university who did not own units or live at the complex. Basically, the university used underhanded tactics to gain control of the condominiums. They eventually bought everyone out, save Vodicka and another individual. Citing problems with asbestos, the roof, mold and sewer lines, the school bulldozed the condos in 2006. Later that year, it became apparent SMU would be the site of Bush's library. The land upon which the condos once sat will be part of the library grounds. Both sides agree on that much. They disagree on whether the school lied about its intentions and breached its legal duty to the other condo owners by letting the place fall into disrepair so that it could be torn down. Seems like a fair-enough complaint.",0
"Title: Dems Go after Gina Haspel with the Torture Smear  Article: Bruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. Gina Haspel, Trumps pick to succeed Mike Pompeo as head of the CIA, is a thirty-year veteran of the agency, one well respected by intelligence professionals from both parties. If confirmed, she will be the first woman to run our most important security agency. But despite this feminist victory, the Dems are likely to muddy the waters at her confirmation hearings by smearing her with allegations she oversaw torture at a black site in Thailand in 2002. Typical of what we can expect is the New York Times editorial titled, Having a Torturer Lead the CIA, even as the charge about the black site was shown to be untrue. Once again, the party bereft of ideas and principle resorts to emotional obfuscation and accusation to advance their ideological prejudices. So, once again, it is necessary to lay out the facts and partisan hypocrisy behind the torture charge that has damaged our ability to gather the intelligence necessary to defend our safety and security. Start with the imprecise or even willfully distorted language that always perfumes unsavory ideologies. In everyday use, torture can mean anything from a visit to the dentist to the sadistic mayhem of brutal regimes like Iran or North Korea. As a result, indiscriminate, lurid connotations and emotions attend the use of a word like torture, which of course is what makes it so useful for partisan smears. Laws, however, have to be more precise.",1
