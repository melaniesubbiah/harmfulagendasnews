"Title: Chinas Communist Party makes persecuting Christians a priority  Article: Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote. Religious experts say China, a country where only state-approved religious exercise is permitted, has one of the fastest growing Christian congregations in the world. The country is on track to have more than 250 million Christians a huge majority of them worshiping in forbidden underground churches by 2030. Unfortunately, Chinas leaders consider the growing religious population a threat to its authoritarian government. Those leaders are setting the stage for what may become one of the biggest religious persecution campaigns in modern history. A 2014 report from The Telegraph declared that the officially-atheist communist country would become the worlds most Christian nation in the next 15 years. But Chinas Christian community is also one of the worlds most imperiled faith groups in the world. For Chinese Christians who opt to worship in churches which have gained the governments seal of approval (only about 30 million of them, according to estimates), a typical service is rife with government propaganda and takes place under the watchful eye of surveillance cameras forcibly installed by the government. Worshipers and church leaders who fail to carry out their faith in a way that pleases the government are frequently attacked, beaten and arrested by police. In recent years, the country has also taken to destroying crucifixes on display in Chinese provinces, confiscating church property, levying hefty arbitrary fines and fees against churches or simply razing places of worship which displease the countrys totalitarian leaders.",1
"Title: The White Man Won  Article: >Hey, Obama is half white, after all. We call him black, but the fact is, hes just as white as he is black, genetically speaking. Which is perfect. Some people think Abraham Lincoln had some African blood in him. Whether or not he did, two skinny tall guys from Illinois, both lawyers and state legislators, both coming from humble beginnings, went on to reach the presidency of the United States of America. The first one freed the black slaves, the second became the first black president. Though he is half white, we call him black. And yet we elected him, overwhelmingly. And, while that is certainly a victory for the black man in America, it is also a victory for the white man in America. For the simple reason that he has overcome his sordid history of racism. In that sense, it is a victory for us all. Even the racists that are presently seething in their hatred as they witness a history they never saw coming may eventually be changed. Why? Because, familiarity brings understanding. Although Mr. & Ms. Bigot may not see it today, eventually, they will have to admit that, hey, this guy is doing a pretty good job. (Because we know hell do a great job.) And theyll see him everyday in the news, conducting their nations business. The country will not turn communist. Obama will not invite Al Qaeda for dinner. They sky will not fall. They will, eventually, see that they were lied to, by their own party this man is no terrorist, he is a true, red, white and blue American. And like the prejudiced person living in a formerly all-white neighborhood, when the black family moves in next door, after some time passes and they get to know them a bit, the prejudice subsides.",0
"Title: Gay Groups Target DOMA with New Lawsuits  Article: News By Peter J. Smith NEW YORK, November 10, 2010 (LifeSiteNews.com)  Two more lawsuits have been launched against the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), bringing even more legal pressure to bear on the beleaguered marriage law. The Gay & Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Hartford, Connecticut on behalf of three homosexual couples and one widower who were denied federal spousal benefits. DOMA must fall, said Mary L. Bonauto, GLADs Civil Rights Project Director. Bonauto contended that the intent of passing DOMA in 1996 was to harm gay people and same-sex families with this law, and sadly, it has succeeded. Married gay and lesbian couples fall through the federal safety nets that exist for other married people, she said. The case is Pedersen et al. v. Office of Personnel Management, and is the second front GLAD has opened up against DOMA. Earlier this summer a U.S. District Judge in Massachusetts ruled unconstitutional Section 3 of DOMA, which defines marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of a man and a woman.",0
"Title: Portland Braces For Blood In The Streets As Antifa Pledges Militant Antifascist Resistance Against Patriot Prayer On Saturday  Article: If Portland authorities do not intervene in a major way, we could potentially see one of the largest street brawls in modern American history on Saturday. On June 30th, an extremely violent confrontation in Portland between Antifa thugs and conservative groups made headlines all over the world, and now both sides have been hyping this August 4th sequel as an even bigger event. Two conservative groups, Patriot Prayer and The Proud Boys, are claiming that they will have thousands of members in the heart of Portland for their scheduled rally, and they are very much encouraging people to bring guns. On the other side, Eugene Antifa, Rose City Antifa, RASH NW and the Pacific Northwest Anti-Fascist Workers Collective are hoping to bring thousands of their own members, and one organizer publicly stated that they better bring our own guns too. All it is going to take is for one person to get shot and killed for all hell to break loose. At the center of this controversy is a conservative Senate candidate named Joey Gibson  For the past week, Vancouver activist, provocateur and senate candidate Joey Gibson has been talking about guns  guns that his friends and supporters with the groups Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys will likely bring to a self-described Freedom Rally in Portland on Saturday. take our poll - story continues below Will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?

"Title: Fellowship of the Minds  Article: I despise the illegal-alien-loving folks in California. From Fox News: The illegal immigrant alien and seven-time felon who was acquitted of murder and assault in the 2015 San Francisco fatal shooting of 32-year old Kate Steinle was sentenced to three years in prison on Friday. Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, who has been in custody since shortly after the shooting, was credited for time served. He will be on parole for 48 months and will remain in custody to face federal charges. The case sparked national debate over immigration reform and so-called Sanctuary Cities that shield illegals from deportation, of which San Francisco is one. The felony possession was the only conviction to come out of Garcia Zarates trial in November. The jury decided Steinles death, the result of a ricochet bullet fired from roughly 100 feet away, was an accident. At a hearing Friday, Garcia Zarate entered the courtroom wearing huge oversized bright orange sweatshirt and sweatpants. He was uncuffed and smiling as he shook the hand of each member of his defense team, including new attorney Tony Serra. His attorneys requested a new trial, but the judge denied the motion. Garcia Zarate is expected to be turned over to U.S.",1
"Title: Islamic Terrorists and Gay Targets  Article: Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism. A few days before the second anniversary of the Pulse massacre in Orlando, Florida, two Muslim terrorists were arrested in a plot to attack gay targets in France. There may be no connection beyond coincidence, but the media would have normally made one anyway if it werent avoiding the subject. The aftermath of Omar Mateens killing spree was one of the modern medias low points. And these days thats a competitively low bar. Cable news ignored Omars declaration that he was an Islamic terrorist and instead wildly speculated that he was secretly gay and homophobic at the same time. Its been established conclusively that the ISIS terrorist wasnt gay. He may not have even known that he was about to open fire in a gay nightclub. His original target had been the Disney Springs mall. And his message began with, In the name of Allah. ISIS has recorded propaganda videos of its fighters fully implementing Sharia law by hurling gay men off buildings. But after the medias misleading coverage, it appeared to urge future attackers to avoid targets where their intentions might be misinterpreted. ISIS had managed to pull of its deadliest attack in America only to have it be attributed to repressed homosexuality instead of the glorious caliphate. A year later, Amer Alhaggagi was indicted for aiding ISIS and plotting murderous terror attacks. 'I'm going to place a bomb in a gay club, Wallah or by Allah,' he allegedly said.",1
"Title: 2.8 Million Barrels Per Day: Activists Pull Off Huge Crude Oil Flow Shut-Down  Article: As a part of ongoing peaceful protests against the construction of new oil pipelines in the United States, protesters across four states halted the flow of crude from Canada by closing station valves. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has sued the US federal government to prevent construction of the 1,160-mile Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), claiming that tribal administration was not consulted, even though the pipeline runs through tribal lands. Thousands have rallied against the pipeline construction, and on Tuesday, protest group Climate Direct Action orchestrated a bold demonstration: cutting through fences surrounding remote flow stations in Washington, Montana, Minnesota, and North Dakota, activists shut down the southward flow of oil through multiple pipelines. ""We are acting in response to this catastrophe we are facing,"" said Afrin Sopariwala, a spokeswoman for the group. At least four individuals were arrested in relation to the stunt, which shut down pipelines belonging to Enbridge Inc., Spectra Energy, TransCanada, and Kinder Morgan.",0
"Title: ISIS Leader Calls for American Muslim Voters to Support Hillary Clinton  Article: Top ISIS leader now believed to be the number two behind the terrorist organization, Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani, put up a video this week following the second presidential debate asking American Muslim voters to support Hillary Clinton. The controversial video that was taken down by YouTube only hours after it was uploaded showed top ISIS leader Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani threatening those who would decide to vote for Donald Trump and calling them infidels and goat f-ers.  All Muslims who will show support for the dog-faced Trump are guilty of masiya (mortal sin)   ISIS No.2 leader, Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani He also claimed that even if Hillary was a woman and a two face devil, had the charm of a pig and was treacherous as the snake, that the Democratic presidential hopeful was at least in league with the allied countries of the Islamic state such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Supporting the dog-faced Trump Al-alwani also warned all Muslims not to take his warnings lightly and that supporters of Trump would be severely punished on earth and in Jannah (afterlife). Trump is a dog, he is the scum of the earth. He boasts that he will take our oil and join Russia, Syria and the Shia Iranians against us in our holy fight he added, visibly angry. This (dog-faced) scumbag must not reach Washington. Although it is a sin to put an inferior being such as a woman into a position of power, it is the true plan of Satan to divide the Muslims of America.",1
"Title: Democracies Die, but Republicanism Lives On  Article: The leftist website Vox.com posted an article on Friday entitled,  How democracies die, explained . Of course, it has to do with the president, but they add, The problems in American democracy run far deeper than Trump. Well, bully for them. Dilly Dilly! Now, right off the bat, we should notice a glaring error. It may stem from calculation or ignorance. In case you missed it, America is not a democracy. However, those of leftist persuasion often refer to the United States as one. We are of course a representative republic. To the ignorant, those who have not been taught the difference, this is understandable. Being ignorant is simply lacking knowledge. No matter how well educated one is, he or she will always be ignorant of something. There are no exceptions. Okay, one. God knows everything. However, knowing the difference and deliberately misleading the ignorant is a different story. This, for want of better term, is malicious.

The nation is slowing coming to fruition. remain based on earth, for the time being, the satellite launch brings the nation one step closer to space. The nanosat is roughly the size of a loaf of bread and undertook a two-day journey from NASAs Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, the United States, to the International Space Station (ISS). It contains 0.5 TB of data belonging to 18,000 of Asgardias citizens, such as family photographs, as well as digital representations of the space nations flag, coat of arms, and constitution. While Asgardias citizens willremain based on earth, for the time being, the satellite launch brings the nation one step closer to space. Asgardia-1 made its journey to the ISS aboard the OA-8 Antares-Cygnus , a NASA commercial cargo vehicle. Now it must wait for about three weeks as vital supplies and scientific equipment are transferred from the NASA ship to the six people currently living at the ISS. The nanosat will then be detached from the NASA vehicle and begin its own orbital journey around the earth. Citizens data will remain in orbit for between five and 18 months, the typical lifespan of this type of satellite. It will then burn out and disappear.

"Title: $4 Million In Gold Bars Stolen In 11th Largest Heist In History  Infinite Unknown  Article: $4 Million In Gold Bars Stolen In 11th Largest Heist In History (ZeroHedge, March 2, 2015): Long-time Zero Hedge readers may remember the rather surreal moment towards the beginning of the long-running German tungsten/gold repatriation saga, when Bundesbank Executive Board member Andreas Dombret assured the NY Fed that Germany wasnt afraid of Simon Gruber (or Goldfinger for that matter) masterminding gold heists in U.S. vaults. Well, since it now appears Germany is all set to ramp up its repatriation efforts (see the NY Feds November monthly outflow numbers), Buba may want to reconsider its stance on the threat posed by ambitious bandits, as less than 24 hours ago, an estimated 4 million in gold bars were commandeered (on the side of I-95 no less), by gun wielding desperados. From CBS: North Carolina authorities and the FBI are investigating the theft of an estimated $4 million worth of gold allegedly stolen during an armed robbery along Interstate 95 on Sunday evening, CBS affiliate WRAL reports. After mechanical problems with their truck, two armed guards who were traveling from Miami to Massachusetts with a shipment of silver and gold pulled over at mile marker 114 on the Interstate. According to the station, the sheriffs office says the guards reported that three armed men in a white van approached them, ordered them to the ground, tied their hands behind their backs and forced them to walk into some nearby woods.",0
"Title: Suicide Note Seen in Vegas Shooters Hotel Room  Article: A mysterious piece of paper discovered last week, when photos from the Las Vegas gunmans hotel room were leaked to the media, is now back in the news cycle. The pictures were published by numerous news outlets and shared by millions of people on social media. At the time the photos were published by the Daily Mail, police had not mentioned if Paddock left behind a note in his hotel room. Nevada Sheriff Joe Lombardo said police were investigating who leaked the crime scene photos. In one photo in particular, a white piece of paper or notepad on a side table next to a chair is visible, which caused some to speculate that it may have been a suicide note. Soon after the photos were leaked, Twitter was abuzz with chatter referencing the paper, with people spreading cover-up conspiracies and rumors that it was a suicide note.

"Title: A Reader Writes On The Merciless Indian Savages Of The Founding Era And An American Woman Who Fought Back | Letters  Article: Re: James Fulfords post Facebook, REASON Magazine, Thomas Jefferson, And The Merciless Indian Savages  From: A German-American Reader [Email him]  With regards to the latest hysterical banning by Facebook of the passage from the Declaration of Independence citing merciless Indian Savages brings up some interesting points. The first is that due to the revisionist history currently in vogue in the United States the only part of the Declaration now remembered is the flowery language in the Preamble stating all men are created equal that specifically, and only refers to the perceived unequal relationship between the British colonists and the Cr own. It was never intended to be a universalism, later used as a justification for a plethora of equal outcome-based laws and social justice programs that bedevil the nation. The Preamble should be interpreted in the context of the entire document, and in the case of the Declaration it was a list of strident grievances (e.g. directed Indian attacks) and demands by the rough and tumble British colonists justifying the colonies breakaway from Great Britain. I am sure the Facebook censorship staff have never read the entire Declaration of Independence before this incident, hence their shock. The second point is that depending on the tribe and circumstances the American Indians could be a nasty lot as was well known at the time being before the era of todays politically correct censorship (e.g. Facebook). And the colonists who did fight back were not hauled off into court for denying the Indians their civil rights.",1
"Title: WHY ARENT WE TAUGHT THIS? Rep. Steve Kings Constitutional Amendment will stop illegal immigrants from being counted as persons in the Census  California gets 4 extra House seats, 4 extra electora  Article: Did you know that every single illegal alien in this country implicitly votes? They dont necessarily vote by casting a ballot. They vote by residing in a state. For every human that goes to sleep and wakes up in a particular state, that state can measure them as a resident. This means a state like California that has 3 million illegal aliens benefits from the presence of criminals. Those people might not vote in an election. But they dont have to. They rely on liberals to elect liberal congressmen and just by being present they enable their legal liberal counterparts to send more liberals to Congress. They dont need to step near a ballot box once. That might stop soon thanks to a Constitutional Amendment, currently known as House Joint Resolution 30 (HJR#30) proposed by Representative Steve King (R-IA4). Article Continues Below That wasnt Rep. Kings only announcement either. Lets take a look at why this is so important: There are 435 seats in the house of representatives  thats a fact that a lot of people know and are comfortable with. But not many people understand how those seats are apportioned. There are buzzwords that get tossed about when its politically convenient to do so and most notably when one thinks of apportionment issues they think of gerrymandering. And thats an issue, sure  Democrats and Republicans alike use the practice of gerrymandering to carve out fiefdoms that are easier to maintain.",1
"Title: Boy Raised by Apes Discovered in Malaysia  Article: Borneo| Malaysian authorities have announced this morning that they had finally been able to capture the feral child of Borneo that had been reported by hundreds of different villagers of the region over the last two last two years and had become the focus of the local media recently. The young boy had been reported to accompany a group of Bornean ourangutans that seemed to have adopted him as one of there own. We are trying to establish the actual age and identity of the boy explains Osman Mahmat Rahman, public relations officer for the Royal Malaysia Police (RMP). The boy is extremely nervous and aggressive when approached by humans and that made his capture quite complicated, especially since the other ourangutans attempted vigorously to defend him. We had to tranquilize three of the adult apes using darts filled with sedatives, before we could lay our hands on the child. We really went to great lengths to make sure we did not injure him during the operation. The boy was immediately taken to the hospital and was put under the custody of agents from the Social Welfare Department. A preliminary evaluation realized by doctors at the Borneo Medical Center, allowed to determine that the boy was in suprisingly good health considering the circumstances, having grown rather normally and showing no signs of malnutrition.",0
"Title: Do It For Denmark Ad Encourages Immoral White Reproduction Instead of Immigration  Article: By Ray Charlston A shockingly offensive video ad is circulating the internet. The ad entitled Do it for Denmark encourages Danish couples to go on a vacation getaway. Demographic data is misleadingly skewed to suggest that there are not enough young Danes to support the aging population of the country. The ad encourages reproduction! Couples who can prove a conception occurred during the getaway will be eligible to win three years worth of free baby supplies! Readers may view the video below. Do so at your own risk however, it is very offensive and blatantly racist and homophobic! Denmark does not need reproduction, what it really needs is immigration, especially from the third world to solve its demographic crisis! Reproducing more Danes does nothing to enrich Danish culture and society. It is also shockingly immoral given the mass starvation, poverty, illiteracy, disease and oppression which those in the third world suffer entirely because of white racism and white privilege. Since homosexuals cannot reproduce through sexual intercourse with persons of the same gender, the entire campaign is blatantly homophobic! Unfortunately, some Danish fear-mongers still ignorantly claim that immigrants are a burden on the economy and that they commit more crime than the native born. It is understandable that in a racist white society, many immigrants would require economic aid in order to survive.",1
"Title: 2009 Keeper of the Flame Award: Dick Cheney  Article: On October 21st in Washington, the Center for Security Policy hosted its annual Keeper of the Flame Award dinner. This years honoree was former Vice President Richard Cheney who used it as a platform for a major policy address  one that provided but the latest validation of the appropriateness of this recognition. Mr. Cheneys extraordinary public service was celebrated by nearly 400 Members of Congress, past and present members of the armed forces, business leaders, journalists and other security policy practitioners at the elegant gala held at Washingtons venerable Union Station. The Vice Presidents remarks constituted an authoritative and forceful critique of the conduct of national defense and foreign affairs under the Obama administration. They received world-wide attention thanks to the coverage given it by ABC News, C-SPAN, the Associated Press, Fox News and the Washington Post. Particular note was made of Mr. Cheneys warning that the White House appeared to be dithering over the strategy for the war in Afghanistan and his call upon President Barack Obama to do what it takes to win. Specifically, the Vice President declared: Make no mistake.",1
"Title: Take a ride on the crazy train  Article: A state of war exists when there is declared or undeclared military conflict. But this is not the only war. A state of war exists when oppressive authority under color of law and seductive persuasion gradually diminishes our natural rights to life, liberty and property. Today we live in a state of war with the U.S. government. The fact that almost no one is aware is a tribute to the deceptiveness of our political process. Why do most people not feel the oppression of government in spite of so many things that look so obvious to some of us? I can give you one answer and I believe it to be true: The more dependent one is on government authority, the less likely he is to see government and its politicians as an adversary. Another answer is the power that government and its change agents have to manipulate language and stoke class, race and political warfare in order to redirect animus away from government. And if you watch carefully you will see that the government and political class change sides on the issues as they ebb and flow in the national discourse. Thats because the only side the government and political class is on is their own side. And its opposite the peoples side. Nowhere is this more evident than the new debate over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the evil stepchild of the Department of Homeland Security. ICE was formed in 2003 in the aftermath of 9/11 as one of the myriad liberty-stealing laws and government agencies created ostensibly to keep us safe. Keep us safe is one of the many code words politicians and other government men use to oppress us.",1
"Title: Progressives Threaten Peaceful Violence In The Wake of Rising Microaggressions  Article: by Dr. Trifecta Tyrone Washington II, D.D., Ph.D, Distinguished Civil Rights Leader Progressives are rightly outraged at the recent spate of white-male terrorist incidents across the US. Whites are attacking innocent people of color, women, sexual minorities, and the trans community. We will no longer stand by and allow this to continue. We can, and we must, stand together now in moral outrage! More and more progressives are talking about peaceful violence. Peaceful violence may sound like a contradiction to some, however, it makes sense when you examine it closely. According to one member of Masked Red Anarchists Destroying Hate, Ill call him Michael: Racism is violence. A racist thought is a violent one. Racists must be met not with ideas or arguments, but only with insults, fists and weapons. That is the language that they understand. The so-called violence we carry out is peaceful. Why? Because its directed against those whose ideas head toward violence. It isnt violence when your victim is a racist non-person. These are Nazis! According to the imminent social scientist and writer, Dr. Norman Frederickson: We must understand that a racist isnt a human being. A racist is a monster! A racist doesnt have any friends, family, or pets. Racists are people who live on pure hatred. They are incapable of love, or compassion. Is their blood red too, like ours? We dont know! The Fascist police protect them, and we cant tell. A more spiritual person might say that racists do not have souls. A privileged white person cannot possibly understand the struggles that people of color face daily in racist, islamophobic, and heterosexist America! People of color have had enough.",1
"Title: Celebrities To Leave US After Election of Racist, Sexist, Islamophobic, and Anti-Semitic Trump!  Article: By Ivan Fernando On November 8th everything changed. Americans voted to entirely repudiate the legacy of our first African-American President, Barack Hussein Obama, and to elect racist, sexist, bigoted, dangerous pathological narcissist Donald J. Trump, as President of the United States of America. My eyes are filled with tears as I write this and my heart is filled with sorrow. In times like this, I ask myself, is life worth living? Like so many progressives, I even contemplated throwing away my own life on that fateful night. Words cannot begin to express the pain, the hopelessness, and the fear, that progressives all around the world are feeling right now, as we tremble dreading the future. In response to this unacceptable outrage, progressives are demanding that this offensive election outcome be overturned in the name of preserving Americas Democracy! Of course, that is very unlikely to happen. Tragically, and inexplicably, Hillary Clinton has conceded the election to Trump, and President Obama has even invited the racist beast to the White House. Americans may think that they can vote for whoever they want, however they will pay a very serious price when they choose to vote for racist, sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic, and anti-Semitic candidates! A very serious price indeed, I assure you! A group of Americas most talented celebrities, including actors and musicians have joined together to form the Not Our Country Anymore Committee. Their purpose is to find an acceptable new country or countries for Americas most brilliant and talented celebrities. America has shown that it is a racist and backward country.",0
"Title: Rasmussen Poll: Trump's Approval Rating Among Black Voters Now 29% vs. 15% One Year Ago  Article: New Rasmussen poll results point to an increase in President Trump's approval among black voters to 29% from 15% one year ago. And it would not take a huge shift in black voter sentiment to sway an election. If the results of this poll, a near doubling of support in one year, are genuine and sustainable, Democrats have reason to worry. Although this news may sound surprising, there are valid reasons for blacks to gravitate toward Trump.

"Title: How is Trump Supposed To Negotiate Immigration When His Opponents Are Constantly Calling Him A ""Racist""?  Article: Once upon a time, it wasnt okay to smear your political opponent with something like racist or bigot without first showing some evidence. Sadly, in todays America, these words get thrown around as if they have no meaning and as if everyone can agree to their usage. The latest example comes to us through the immigration debate where the left and the media continue to attack the President for supposedly calling some 3rd world nation(s) sh**holes, something the President denies ever saying (and several of the people in the meeting have backed him up on this point). Heres the problem, while the Presidents language may be vulgar and his word choice poor, its a sentiment that most Americans agree with, and its at the heart of a larger debate about how we choose migrants to accept into our nation. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) made a similar argument while defending the President from his detractors, on NBCs Meet the Press when he asked how the President is supposed to negotiate on DACA and illegal immigration if his opponents are all calling him a racist. Its as if the left doesnt actually want to negotiate a compromise, they simply want to smear the President and make compromise impossible. Rand Paul: I dont think the comments were constructive at all. But I also think that to be fair, we shouldnt draw conclusions that he didnt intend. I know personally about his feelings towards Haiti and towards Central America because when I was not a candidate for president and he wasnt a candidate for president, I went down there on a medical mission trip. I did about 200 cataract surgeries with a group of surgeons in Haiti and the same in Central America.",1
"Title: Young men giving up on marriage: Women arent women anymore  Article: NewsFamily Fewer young men in the US want to get married than ever, while the desire for marriage is rising among young women, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew recently found that the number of women 18-34 saying that having a successful marriage is one of the most important things rose from 28 percent to 37 percent since 1997. The number of young adult men saying the same thing dropped from 35 percent to 29 percent in the same time. Pews findings have caught the attention of one US writer who maintains that feminism, deeply entrenched in every segment of the culture, has created an environment in which young men find it more beneficial to simply opt out of couple-dom entirely. Suzanne Venkers article, The War on Men, which appeared on the website of Fox News in late November, has become a lodestone for feminist writers who have attacked her position that the institution of marriage is threatened, not enhanced, by the supposed gains of the feminist movement over the last 50 years. Where have all the good (meaning marriageable) men gone? is a question much talked about lately in the secular media, Venker says, but her answer, backed up by statistics, is not to the liking of mainstream commentators influenced by feminism. STORY: My father raped his daughter. And I am their baby. My story. She points out that for the first time in US history, the number of women in the workforce has surpassed the number of men, while more women than men are acquiring university degrees. The problem? This new phenomenon has changed the dance between men and women, Venker wrote.",1
