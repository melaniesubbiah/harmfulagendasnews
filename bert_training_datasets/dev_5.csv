"Title: ISIS Leader Calls for American Muslim Voters to Support Hillary Clinton  Article: Top ISIS leader now believed to be the number two behind the terrorist organization, Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani, put up a video this week following the second presidential debate asking American Muslim voters to support Hillary Clinton. The controversial video that was taken down by YouTube only hours after it was uploaded showed top ISIS leader Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani threatening those who would decide to vote for Donald Trump and calling them infidels and goat f-ers.  All Muslims who will show support for the dog-faced Trump are guilty of masiya (mortal sin)   ISIS No.2 leader, Amadh Abu Makmud Al-alwani He also claimed that even if Hillary was a woman and a two face devil, had the charm of a pig and was treacherous as the snake, that the Democratic presidential hopeful was at least in league with the allied countries of the Islamic state such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Supporting the dog-faced Trump Al-alwani also warned all Muslims not to take his warnings lightly and that supporters of Trump would be severely punished on earth and in Jannah (afterlife). Trump is a dog, he is the scum of the earth. He boasts that he will take our oil and join Russia, Syria and the Shia Iranians against us in our holy fight he added, visibly angry. This (dog-faced) scumbag must not reach Washington. Although it is a sin to put an inferior being such as a woman into a position of power, it is the true plan of Satan to divide the Muslims of America.",1
"Title: Gay Groups Target DOMA with New Lawsuits  Article: News By Peter J. Smith NEW YORK, November 10, 2010 (LifeSiteNews.com)  Two more lawsuits have been launched against the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), bringing even more legal pressure to bear on the beleaguered marriage law. The Gay & Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Hartford, Connecticut on behalf of three homosexual couples and one widower who were denied federal spousal benefits. DOMA must fall, said Mary L. Bonauto, GLADs Civil Rights Project Director. Bonauto contended that the intent of passing DOMA in 1996 was to harm gay people and same-sex families with this law, and sadly, it has succeeded. Married gay and lesbian couples fall through the federal safety nets that exist for other married people, she said. The case is Pedersen et al. v. Office of Personnel Management, and is the second front GLAD has opened up against DOMA. Earlier this summer a U.S. District Judge in Massachusetts ruled unconstitutional Section 3 of DOMA, which defines marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of a man and a woman.",0
"Title: The End of the Church of Slogans?  Article: But Franciss handpicked coordinator of the Council, Cardinal Oscar ( Mad Dog ) Rodrguez Maradiaga of Honduras, has just been exposed as a financial huckster thriving on the backs of the poor about which he pontificates constantly in the usual manner of a Latin American leftist ideologue. Is anyone surprised? Before discussing the details of the scandal and its significance for the Church at large, a few words about the Cardinals background are in order. Like every other propaganda theme concocted by the Vatican apparatus since Vatican II, including the conciliar springtime, dialogue with the world, the liturgical renewal, the ecumenical venture and the New Evangelization, the theme of Francis the Great Reformer is a hoax that conceals an underlying, ever-worsening state of ecclesial dissolution whose scope is without precedent in Church history. Francis the Great Reformer was supposed to accomplish the mighty work of converting a self-referential Church into the Church of the Pooranother hoaxwith the aid of a Council of Cardinalsyet another hoaxthat would help him reform the Roman Curia and decentralize Roman authority in favor of the peripheriesstill another hoax. Who is Oscar Rodrguez Maradiaga? Before Franciss election, Oscar Rodrguez Maradiaga (commonly referred to by his second surname despite the Latin American convention) had fallen into obscurity during the reign of John Paul II, following his involvement in the Caritas Internationalis scandal.",1
"Title: A Good Leak  Article: Last weekend, the FBI arrested an employee of a corporation in Augusta, Georgia, that had a contract with the National Security Agency and charged her with espionage. Espionage occurs when someone who has been entrusted to safeguard state secrets fails to do so. In this case, the government alleges that the person to whom state secrets had been entrusted is 25-year-old Reality Leigh Winner, who had a top-secret national security clearance. The government claims that Winner downloaded and printed a top-secret NSA report, removed the printed version of the report from her employers premises, and then mailed it to The Intercept, a highly regarded international media outlet that exposes government wrongdoing. The government says it learned of this when folks from The Intercept called the NSA and told agents what they had received and what they planned to publish. After hearing agents describe the potential harm to their work if the full report were to be released, The Intercept agreed to redact certain portions, though it published the bulk of the report. Time to buy old US gold coins The report is startling, as it reveals that the NSA discovered that Russian hackers in late October and early November 2016 planted cookies (attractive, uniquely tailored links) into the websites of 122 American city and county clerks responsible for counting ballots in the The Constitution in Ex...

"Title: Researchers conclude: Proxima B has OCEANS and may well harbour ALIEN LIFE  Article: According to researchers, the second Earth, aka Proxima B has vast oceans covering its surface and may harbor alien life. Experts from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) concluded that it si very likely that the rocky planet discovered in the habitable zone of its star is covered by oceans. Researchers discovered Proxima B in August and believe it is the first exoplanet that is within our reach. The alien world is located just over 4 light-years from Earth. It is believed to have a mass 1.4 times that of Earth and orbits its host star at a distance of 7.5 million kilometers, which is one-tenth of the distance between Mercury and our Sun, or 5 percent the distance between our planet and the Sun. Proxima B takes just 11.2 days to complete an orbit around its host star. Contrary to what one might expect, such proximity does not necessarily mean that Proxima Bs surface is too hot for water to exist in liquid form, said a CNRS statement. The Host Star Proxima Centauriis smaller and around 1000 times weaker when compared to our sun.",0
"Title: Kim Jong-uns Peace Gambit  Article: It appears that the outreach to South Korea by North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, which began in the lead-up to and during the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, did not end with the Olympics closing ceremony. Kim Jong-un has just hosted talks with a high-level delegation from South Korea, led by its national security director Chung Eui-yong. The South Korean delegation came away believing that these talks have borne some fruit. A possible summit meeting between Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in was discussed, which could occur in late April at the so-called Peace House, which is located on the South Korean side of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone. In the meantime, the two Koreas have reportedly agreed to set up a telephone hotline between the leaders of both countries. The South Koreans also indicated that North Korea would agree to halt tests of its nuclear weapons and missiles in conjunction with opening talks with the United States on the denuclearization issue. According to Chung Eui-yong, the North Koreans are looking for a credible security guarantee and the end to military threats against it, in which case they believed they would not need to keep their nuclear arsenal. He claimed that North Korea was interested ""in an open-ended dialogue to discuss the issue of denuclearization and to normalize relations with North Korea."" Notably, Kim Jong-un is said to have withdrawn, at least for now, his insistence that the United States and South Korea suspend their joint military exercises as a precondition to any negotiations.",0
"Title: Obamas Thug-In-Chief John Brennan blames Trump and Netanyahu for Palestinian deaths in Gaza  Article: Here is clear evidence of John Brennan siding with the jihad force. This is typical of the leftists who filled the Obama administration.

Tens of thousands of Jew-hating Muslims storm Israels border chanting Khaybar, Khaybar, the genocidal chant of Jew-hating Muslims evoking Muhammads extermination of an entire tribe of Jews, are further proof that the Muslim war on the Jews is a religious war, not a geographical one.

"Title: U.S Scrambles Jets as Tensions Threaten to Explode in Syria, Ukraine, S. China Sea  Article: As of late, with so many military actions and airstrikes occurring, it almost appears as if we could be seeing the beginning steps of the predicted WWIII. Russian airstrikes are taking place in rebel-controlled parts of Aleppo in the northwestern regions of Syria. As this is occurring we watched as the United States rushed to protect coalition forces from Syrian fighter jets in the northeastern Village known as Hasaka. A city in northeastern Syria has become a flash-point in the countrys civil war as Syrian warplanes attack Kurdish forces Thursday, reports VOA, and the United States responded by sending in its own aircraft to protect U.S. coalition forces in the area. However, according to the Pentagon, Russia states they take no responsibility for the strikes, and in regards to Russia, we made clear that coalition aircraft would defend its troops on the ground it threatened. With the spotlight shining on Russia as of lately, as it recently was revealed that Russia was using an Iranian air base to launch strikes in Aleppo, which would highlight a cooperative military tie between the two countries. Taking this information into consideration, TIME even claimed that there could be a new axis of evil taking place between Russia, Syria, and Iran. Since this information was brought to light, Russia claims they have discontinued use of the Iranian air base. While the story was breaking about U.S jets scrambling in Northeastern Syria, Japan announced that it was seeking a massive upgrade to its F-15 fighters that could double their payload capacity.",1
"Title: Idea for the DK: Adopt a senator campaign.  Article: So my idea is a DKos campaign: Adopt a senator. This would certainly be for those of us who are in fairly safe blue areas, with reps very likely to be re-elected. But also for those who can take on more than a race or two at a time. I imagine the effort starting with a list of vulnerable democratic senate seats, as well as a list of democratic senatorial candidates running against incumbent republican senators. We put that out, and ask for adopters. The role of adopters would be to give money and time where they can. Hopefully, we might be able to have a running feature on this, with feed back from adopters telling us what they're doing for their new ""baby."" I want to note here, that if all anyone could give was a bit of money, that would be great. The idea is not to make the adopter feel weighed down by the responsibility. The idea is to put a chorus of angels behind our vulnerable democratic senators, and our democratic candidates that could do anything from donating, to phone canvassing, to getting to know that district and dropping good links in the appropriate places, or signing relevant petitions. Maybe the most you do as an adopter is show up on line on the pertinent sites and cheer lead. To each their own as to what they can give. I also wonder if the Dkos could partner with another progressive outlet, such as moveon or the Color of Change, to name just two, in promoting this campaign. I must be honest to say, I don't have the computer savvy to pull this off on my own, and I don't have the time to do so either.",0
"Title: Dresden's annihilation shown in World War Two video  Article: Harrowing footage from World War Two showing the annihilation of the German city of Dresden by Allied forces has resurfaced on the anniversary of the bombings which killed up to 25,000 people. Video from 1945, shown as part of an American news report, shows the fearsome bomb attacks undertaken by the RAF on the night of February 13. One shot from the footage shows an RAF plane being struck by an anti-aircraft gun, which the narrator describes as a 'scarecrow' in his voiceover. The clip also shows American bombers moving over the east German city the following day, where they dropped more bombs in an effort to stop Hitler's forces fending off the Soviet advance from the east. At the start of the clip, with the American narrator describing the Allied attacks, British bombers are seen high above the Saxony city. Dresden is then seen at night, with the aerial view showing the terrifying sound and light of the explosions. One British plane falls victim to the 'scarecrow', which the narrator calls 'Goebbels's secret weapon', with a frightening explosion in the sky. Some 650,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on Dresden's transportation lines by RAF Lancaster planes, according to the narrator, hampering the German forces. The bombings then continue to ravage the city before American bombers from the Eighth Air Force are seen leaving vapour trails behind them as they join in the attack.",0
"Title: Muslim students want Florida student expelled for refusing to try on a hijab on Hijab Day  Article: Imposing Islamic absolutism on the public square continues apace. Kathy Zhu is a 19-year-old student at the University of Central Florida. She was offered to try on a hijab on Hijab Day. She refused and posted a message on Twitter to criticize the initiative. After that, the Muslim organizers asked the University to expel her. All of this is revolting (and predictable). What may not be necessarily predictable is that the young woman is not backing off and arguing against these thugs on Twitter. The University has since issued a message to indicate that the student would not be expelled. Here is a video released by Kathy Zhu explaining her position and talking about the snowflake mentality: (thanks to Gisele)  https://twitter.com/PoliticalKathy/status/959237457962242048/video/1  It bears mentioning that there are no Star of David Day or Wear the Cross Day either.

"Title: Blowback: CNN Pushes Effort to Ban the Term Fake News'  Article: This article was originally published by Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars.com  CNN is now pushing an effort to ban the term fake news after the slogan became synonymous with CNN itself thanks to President Donald Trump. In a CNN opinion piece written by Hossein Derakhshan and Claire Wardle, who are affiliated with the globalist Council of Europe, the authors argue that the term fake news has become meaningless and lost its power because politicians (primarily Donald Trump) have hijacked it as a way to undermine the media establishment. The authors decry the fact that many people now believe the mainstream media peddles fabricated stories and that information monopolies are being challenged by the ability for anyone in the world to have a platform. Remember when the mainstream media & the Hillary campaign invented the term ""fake news"" in an effort to discredit alternative & right of center media outlets? Yeah, that went well. pic.twitter.com/HJPpIQEr4j  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) November 27, 2017  Complaining that less powerful agents can harm large institutions or established individuals, Derakhshan and Wardle warn that trust in institutions is declining and that only through intervention at the level of public education (ie indoctrination) can this be reversed. Of course, the real reason media elites want to clamp down on the term fake news is because its original intention, to smear and discredit opponents of Hillary Clinton, right of center media outlets, and people who distrust the mainstream media, has completely backfired.",0
"Title: Child Hunger Is Exploding In Greece  And 14 Signs That It Is Starting To Happen In America Too  Article: Michael Snyder Activist Post The world is heading into a horrific economic nightmare, and an inordinate amount of the suffering is going to fall on innocent children. If you want to get an idea of what America is going to look like in the not too distant future, just check out what is happening in Greece. At this point, Greece is experiencing a full-blown economic depression. As I have written about previously, the unemployment rate in Greece has now risen to 27 percent, which is much higher than the peak unemployment rate that the U.S. economy experienced during the Great Depression of the 1930s. And as you will read about below, child hunger is absolutely exploding in Greece right now. Some families are literally trying to survive on pasta and ketchup. But dont think for a moment that it cant happen here. Sadly, the truth is that child hunger is already rising very rapidly in our poverty-stricken cities. Never before have we had so many Americans unable to take care of themselves. Food stamp enrollment and child homelessness have soared to brand new all-time records, and there are actually thousands of Americans who are so poor that they live in tunnels underneath our cities. But for millions of other Americans, the suffering is not quite so dramatic. Instead, they just watch their hopes and their dreams slowly slip away as they struggle to find a way to make it from month to month. There are millions of parents that lead lives that are filled with constant stress and anxiety as they try to figure out how to provide the basics for their children. How do you tell a child that you cant give them any dinner even though you have been trying as hard as you can?",0
"Title: Polish Parliament to vote this week on new bill to ban abortion  Article: NewsAbortion WARSAW, Poland, January 10, 2017 (LifeSiteNews)  Polish pro-lifers are trying again to force a vote in Parliament to establish an abortion ban, with legislators facing an initial vote on a new bill January 12. In October, the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) killed a bill to ban abortion proposed by the Stop Abortion Committee. The bill was the work of a grassroots movement and, contrary to foreign press reports, was started neither by the Catholic Church nor by the government. The Polish democratic system enables a group of citizens to initiate legislation in the lower chamber of the Parliament, called the Sejm, by gathering 100,000 signatures. The citizens initiative on abortion received more than 450,000 signatures. Several organizations were behind the bill, including the Ordo Iuris Institute for Legal Culture and The Right to Life Foundation. The proposed law left punishing women who committed abortions to the discretion of judges, a provision rejected by some pro-life organizations. In response, the Polish Federation of Pro-Life Movements created a similar bill without legal responsibility for women, giving the pro-lifers a chance to ban abortions. Their bill was presented to the lower house of the Parliament in September 2016. The Polish Federation of Pro-Life Movements drafted it and sent it to the Sejms Commission on Petitions. The Ordo Iuris and The Right to Life Foundation recently supported their actions, and the bill will be voted on January 12. The failure of the Sejm to ban abortion in 2016 means that the 1993 law is still in place.",0
"Title: San Francisco afraid to enforce buffer zone ordinance; Planned Parenthood ticked  Article: The PulseAbortion, Freedom In the aftermath of the Supreme Courts June 26 decision striking down Massachusetts 35-foot buffer zone law, the City of San Francisco has become squishy about enforcing its buffer zone ordinance, ticking off Planned Parenthood in the process. San Franciscos ordinance, which bans abortion opponents from entering a 25-foot line of demarcation around abortion clinics, is virtually identical to Massachusetts now voided law, minus 10 feet. Now, San Francisco pro-life activists are allegedly feeling their oats and defying the ordinance by crossing the line. Meanwhile, city attorneys are rightfully worried that enforcing the ordinance will draw pro-life ire and a lawsuit. So theyve chosen instead to withstand pro-abortion ire by ignoring the pro-life provocateurs, which has resulted in a letter of complaint from Planned Parenthood. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, July 27: Planned Parenthood executives say San Francisco police and the city attorney arent doing enough to protect patients and staff from harassment and intimidation at the organizations health center on Valencia Street [pictured above]. Each week, as the harassment and intimidation escalate the citys ordinances are violated ever more flagrantly, Planned Parenthoods Bay Area chapter leader, Heather Saunders Estes,wrote in a July 22 letter to City Attorney Dennis Herrera. And when center staffers call police, they are told that there is nothing they can do, Saunders Estes wrote. The protesters now ignore San Franciscos 25-foot buffer zone as they pass out literature, and film staffers and patients entering the building, clinic reps complain.",0
"Title: Kirov court finds Navalny guilty of embezzlement at Kirovles firm  Article: Kirov court finds Navalny guilty of embezzlement at Kirovles firm The Leninsky District Court in Kirov has found opposition figure Alexei Navalny guilty of embezzlement at the Kirovles company. Having considered materials of the case against Navalny and Pyotr Ofitserov, the court established that Navalny masterminded the embezzlement, judge Sergei Blinov said at the trial. Ofitserov was found guilty of assisting the embezzlement, the judge said. The Leninsky District Court of Kirov started to hear the criminal case on embezzlement from the Kirovles company on April 17. The prosecution claims that more than 10,000 cubic meters of timber was stolen from Kirovles between May and September 2009, inflicting damages of more than 16 million rubles on the Kirov region's administration. Navalny, who at that time served as an advisor to regional governor Nikita Belykh, is accused of organizing the alleged theft. Ofitserov, who headed Vyatka Timber Company, and Kirovles chief executive Vyacheslav Opalev were accused of complicity in the alleged embezzlement. Navalny is charged with ""organization of the embezzlement of an exceptionally large amount of property"". In December 2012 Opalev was given a suspended four-year sentence with a probation period of three years.",0
"Title: Anti-Gay Activist Claims Beauty and the Beast Promotes Inter-Species Breeding %%  Article: Sweet six-and-a-half pound baby Jesus! Who knew that Disneys beloved Beauty and the Beast promotes inter-species breeding? Anti-gay activist Kevin Swanson, who previously warned us that How to Train Your Dragons Gobber the Belch is Destroying Civilization, really hates gays. And he really hates the idea of a human having sex with another species, even when that whole idea is only in his own mind. Because there is no shape-shifting. And no curses that cause shape-shifting. It just doesnt happen. I dont want to suggest this is a very purient case of projection, but folks, this is a very purient case of projection. PFAWs Kyle Mantyla tells us that Swanson said Beauty and the Beast was an insidious effort to homosexualize the next generation of eight and ten-year-old kids and ensure that they are indoctrinated into the homosexual lifestyle. This is how revolutions take place. You are in the middle of a cultural revolution in the United States of America. No, this is not the cultural revolution that Mao Tse-tung brought to China; this is a different kind of cultural revolution, but Im going to say its just about as dangerous  though a bit more insidious. Its the Frozen scandal all over again. The water has gotten a bit too deep for Swanson, just as it was for Michele Bachmann when she attacked Disney for turning our kids gay. But his oxygen-starved mind wasnt done: Even worse, Mantyla writes, Swanson said, the film is promoting inter-species breeding, which he said Hollywood has been pushing since the days of Star Trek. Film history, Swanson! Why did it take so long to notice Disneys unwholesome proclivities?",0
"Title: Final countdown to World War III  Article: Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE When all of the dots are connected, the picture will reveal the agenda of destruction and the perpetrators of peril. Through our inaction, we have been brought to the doorstep of destruction Final countdown to World War III It was precisely three years ago when I wrote that World War III will begin in Syria. I wrote that Syria, not Iran, will be the flashpoint between the United States and Russia, based on information given to me by a source within our own intelligence community. I wrote that we were seeing the final acts of a carefully choreographed play being performed on the world stage, where the script was written long ago by the globalist playwrights. (CFP Oct. 8, 2012) I warned that if left to proceed as written, the entire geopolitical world and balance of power could, and most likely will, change with this next curtain call. No one will be left untouched by the coming events. We are at the precipice of World War III. That was in October of 2012. Today, we are now seeing the final curtain call for the next act by the current headline in the corporate controlled mass media: Russia has begun airstrikes in Syria, the West is disputing their targets, and Putin has told the U.S. and the West to stand down. For those who have been paying attention to the machinations of the globalists, this headline should come as no surprise. World war is looming and getting closer by the minute. We are now at the scene where it should all be making much more sense, even to those who continue to cling to their normalcy bias and refuse to see the breadth and depth of the lies weve been told.",1
"Title: Jahi McMath may be past the point of recovery as her condition deteriorates, family says  Article: NewsEnd of Life January 8, 2014 (LifeSiteNews.com)  The body of 13-year-old Jahi McMath may have so deteriorated in the 25 days since she was declared brain dead that it may be impossible for her to recover, her family's attorney said today. On December 8, Jahi McMath experienced severe complications from a tonsillectomy at Children's Hospital in Oakland, California, and fell into a coma. Doctors declared her brain dead on December 12. I want her on [the ventilator] as long as possible, because I really believe that God will wake her up, her mother, Nailah Winkfield, said. But in California a person is considered deceased the moment he or she is declared brain dead. Hospital attorney Douglas Straus said flatly that the hospital would not perform medical procedures on the body of a deceased human being. The decision generated nationwide sympathy for the young girl and her family. The Terri Schiavo Life and Hope Network (Terris Network) joined the battle, issuing a statement last Tuesday that the child retains all the functional attributes of a living person, despite her brain injury. This includes a beating heart, circulation and respiration, the ability to metabolize nutrition and more. Jahi is a living human being. Last Friday, California's Alameda County Superior Court granted the family the right to remove their daughter from Children's Hospital.",0
"Title: Kate Steinle Verdict Proves Lawless Protected In US  Article: In light of the verdict against Jose Garcia Zarate in the murder of Kate Steinle, it is no surprise that massive protests turned into violent riots have erupted across the united States. Oh, wait, that hasn't happened. Why hasn't that happened? Unlike the leftist, liberal, progressive, intolerant for everything American loony toons, law-abiding citizens and constitutionalists believe in the rule of law meaning unruly riotous street protests across the nation are seen as the wrong method to affect change. Despite the leftist, liberal, progressive, intolerant population's use of these tactics to undermine the rule of law and advance political ideology anathema to our Constitution, law-abiding citizens understand these tactics would not work in the current political climate where law is what the Democrat Party of Hussein Soetoro and Hillary Clinton decide it to be at the time. What is lawful is now lawless and what is lawless is now lawful  but only for the ""special"" class of individuals in the united States whether they are citizen or illegal invader. The Daily Caller reported the Department of Justice unsealed a warrant for Jose Garcia Zarate on the charge of ""supervised release violation.""

"Title: Boeing Must Produce Iran Air Contract to Terror Victims  Article: The Trump administration pointedly put national security over trade when it told an Illinois District Court judge it does not take a position on whether the Court should shield aerospace giant Boeing Corp from a lawsuit filed by victims of Iranian state terrorism. The family of Shlomo Leibovitch is seeking to collect on a $67 million judgment against Iran for a 2003 terror attack that killed their seven-year old daughter, and sued Boeing to gain access to what it believed were Iranian assets in Boeings possession. Boeing signed a $16 billion deal in 2016 to sell civilian airliners to the state-owned Iran Air, a defendant in numerous lawsuits by victims of Iranian state-sponsored terrorism. In any airplane deal of that size, the purchaser will make advance payments while the aircraft are being produced. It was those payments the Leibovitch family was seeking to attach and that Boeing was seeking to conceal. Chief Judge Ruben Castillo ruled on Tuesday that Boeing must produce the contractual documents to the terror victims, to include financial documents relating to advance payments as well as Boeings communications with the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control, which licensed the sale during the final weeks of the Obama administration. Boeing had argued to keep all details of its commercial and financial dealings with the Iranian regime secret, on the grounds that disclosing them would cause significant harm to the goals of the United States and its European allies.",1
"Title: The Trump Investigation and the Libyan War  Article: The Libyan War may have been Hillary's biggest scandal. It's also the scandal that hardly anyone talks about. After the murder of three Americans in Benghazi, conservative interest largely narrowed down to that particular incident rather than the larger context of the illegal war. But now it looks like the investigation of the Trump investigation is headed toward Libya,  In the heavily redacted, declassified version of the letter, which outlined why Graham and Grassley asked the Justice Department to consider opening a criminal investigation into Steeles communications with the FBI, the senators allege that Clinton associates were feeding Mr. Steele accusations against the Trump campaign, thereby calling into question Steeles credibility as a neutral source. Two sources familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, told me the redacted portions of the letter refer to the information compiled by Shearerfor the first time revealing some of the key details that were redacted in the original letter. Shearers information was passed to Steele by Winer. Winer, a friend of Steeles, was then serving as the special envoy for Libya, and had previously passed Steeles Russia and Ukraine reports along to the State Departments Europe bureau between 2014 and 2016... According to a source familiar with the matter, however, Steeles memorandum was actually a handwritten note on a copy of Shearers report that outlined its originthe foreign sub-source who had been in touch with Shearer. The note identified Shearer as a contact of Sidney Blumenthals, a longtime associate of the Clintons.",1
"Title: Mitt Romneys Ohio Problem  Article: Weve all heard the axiom, as goes Ohio, so goes the nation. In fact, no Republican has ever won the Presidency without winning Ohio. And for this years GOP presidential primary, Ohio is the top prize in what is turning out to be a critical Super Tuesday on March 6th. In fact, just yesterday analyst Sean Trende of Real Clear Politics identified Ohio as the key state between a Romney runaway and the possibility of a brokered convention. So the viability of a three-way split probably comes down to Ohio, which has a fair number of evangelicals, though not to the degree that Tennessee, Oklahoma and Georgia do. Santorum has some strengths he can draw on in the Buckeye State, as his blue-collar message could play well even among Republicans there. If he wins, it means that we probably do have a deeply divided GOP, with Gingrich taking the anti-Romney vote in the South, and Santorum taking the anti-Romney vote in the Midwest. So with Ohio holding such incredible importance to Mitt Romneys hopes of becoming President, why is he betraying the very Ohio conservatives he needs to assure victory? Let me explain. As many of you may have read already, Ohio Republicans are currently in the midst of a major power struggle between moderate Ohio Republican Party Chairman Kevin DeWine and Governor John Kasich, Ohio House Speaker William Batchelder, and other conservative elected officials. Conservatives are up in arms against DeWine for a number of offenses, such as actively working against Governor Kasich in the mainstream media, by working to divert fundraisers away from Kasich near the end of his close battle against incumbent Gov.",0
