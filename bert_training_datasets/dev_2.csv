"Title: Iowas Declaration of the Humanity of the Unborn  Article: TheBlaze.com reported this weekend, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a law Friday that bans most abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected, something that typically happens around six weeks into a pregnancy. The new law scheduled to go into effect July 1, gives Iowa the most restrictive abortion regulation in the country, according to published reports. At the Institute on the Constitution, we applaud this legislation as a positive step. It is a breath of moral clarity and sanity whereby government is declaring the pre-born to be human, which, by the way, is something the former Democratic nominee for President, Hilary Clinton, has already acknowledged when she stated, The unborn person doesn't have constitutional rights. take our poll - story continues below  Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?

"Title: ""Clinton Foundation Is Charity Fraud Of Epic Proportions"", Analyst Charges In Stunning Takedown  Article: In early May, we introduced readers to Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who uncovered financial discrepancies at General Electric before its stock crashed in 2008, and whom the Sunday Times of London described as ""one of the finest analysts of financial statements on the planet"" in a 2009 story detailing the troubles at AIG. Having moved on beyond simple corporate fraud, Ortel spent the past year and a half digging into something more relevant to the current US situation:""charities"", and specifically the Clinton Foundations public records, federal and state-level tax filings, and donor disclosures. Four months ago, Ortel began releasing his preliminary findings in the first of a series of up to 40 planned reports on his website. His allegation was simple: this is a charity fraud. To learn more about the Clinton Foundation, Ortel decided to ""take it apart and see how it worked"" and he has been doing that ever since February 2015. I decided, as I did with GE, lets pick one thats complicated, said Ortel. The Clinton Foundation is complicated, but its really very small compared to GE. When Ortel tried to match up the Clinton Foundations tax filings with the disclosure reports from its major donors, he said he started to find problems. That includes records from the foundations many offshootsincluding the Clinton Health Access Initiative and the Clinton Global Initiativeas well as its foreign subsidiaries. ""I decided it would be fun to cross-check what their donors thought they did when they donated to the Clinton Foundation, and thats when I got really irritated, he said.",1
"Title: Former ISIS soldier emasculated by goat seeks refugee status in Canada  Article: Toronto | A Syrian man who has been asking the Canadian government for refugee status after suffering medical complications is suspected by Canadian authorities to be a former ISIS soldier. Abdullah Chaoukat, 36, has demanded refugee status after claiming that an incident with a goat has left him emasculated and that he had since been ostracized by his community and feared for his life. The man claims that since he is no longer fertile, his family has rejected him and he has been the victim of many death threats from his community. At first, people just make jokes at me, call me goat f***er, but then my wife and her family almost beat me to death, he explained. The goat performed oral sex on me only one time, one time too much. I did not know they could chew so hard.",0

Future generations of free Britons, if there are any, will curse the name of Theresa May as the destroyer of free Britain.

"Title: Democracies Die, but Republicanism Lives On  Article: The leftist website Vox.com posted an article on Friday entitled,  How democracies die, explained . Of course, it has to do with the president, but they add, The problems in American democracy run far deeper than Trump. Well, bully for them. Dilly Dilly! Now, right off the bat, we should notice a glaring error. It may stem from calculation or ignorance. In case you missed it, America is not a democracy. However, those of leftist persuasion often refer to the United States as one. We are of course a representative republic. To the ignorant, those who have not been taught the difference, this is understandable. Being ignorant is simply lacking knowledge. No matter how well educated one is, he or she will always be ignorant of something. There are no exceptions. Okay, one. God knows everything. However, knowing the difference and deliberately misleading the ignorant is a different story. This, for want of better term, is malicious. The articles author, Javier Zarracina, explains that in days gone by, democracies would fall in coups and revolutions, burn in fires and riots, collapse amid war and plague. When they die, they die screaming. , explain in their new book,  , that modern democracies, erode slowly, in barely visible steps. They rot from the inside, poisoned by leaders who subvert the very process that brought them to power.

"Title: Dutch Study Shows Patients Requesting Euthanasia Likely Depressed  Article: News By Hilary White LEIDEN, January 16, 2006 (LifeSiteNews.com)  A study published by Dutch researchers in the September 20, 2005 edition of the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) has shown that at least 50% of patients killed under the Dutch euthanasia programme were suffering from depression. In addition, 44% of those suffering from cancer showed clinical signs of depression when they asked for euthanasia. Titled, Euthanasia and Depression: A Prospective Cohort Study Among TerminallyIll Cancer Patients, the study reports that the risk to request euthanasia for patients with depressed mood was 4 times higher than that of patients without a depressed mood. The significance of the study is sharpened since the researchers themselves admitted to a strong bias against their own findings. The researchers at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands, wrote that they were uncomfortable with the idea that a request for euthanasia is a symptom of depression and that the patients request for suicide should be deferred until his depression was treated. The authors bias in favour of the Dutch euthanasia doctrine is clear: The patients wish to hasten death cannot be put on par with a well-considered and persistent request for euthanasia in an environment where euthanasia is customary. Our clinical impression was that such requests were well considered decisions, thoroughly discussed with healthcare workers and family. We thought the patients requesting euthanasia were more accepting their impending death and we therefore expected them to be less depressed.",0
"Title: Get Ready To Pack Your Bags  Article: Things are about to heat up in the EU. Italys ministers threaten the EU/EMU with mass deportations. Italys new leaders tell 500,000 immigrants: Pack Your Bags. The right-wing Lega party, which formed a coalition government with Five-Star Movement (M5S) last week, is the driving force behind anti-immigration rhetoric and it is looking to fulfil a pledge to deport as many as 500,000 illegal migrants. Lega leader Matteo Salvini  who is now Italys deputy prime minister and interior minister  reiterated the governments aim to deport illegal migrants on a visit to Sicily last weekend. On Saturday, speaking at a rally in northern Italy, Salvini had told illegal migrants get ready to pack your bags. On Sunday, Salvini said the only way to avoid more deaths was to stop people getting on boats in the first place. He caused a diplomatic row by accusing Tunisia of sending convicts over to Italy in migrant boats. Michael Flynn, executive director of the GDP, told CNBC that the Italian governments proposals to deport around 500,000 people were ridiculous, costly and impracticable. Amazon.com Gift Card i... Buy New $25.00 (as of 02:05 EDT - Details)  Noting that Italy managed to remove, by forced deportations and voluntary returns, nearly 6,000 people in 2016 and 6,500 in 2017, when it had bed space for less than 400 in its immigration detention centers, Flynn said removing more people was unfeasible. Imagine the size of the system necessary to detain 500,000 people to facilitate their deportation? It is an absurd sum of money, not even counting the cost of the deportation flights.",1
"Title: Food Inflation Comes To America: General Mills, Kraft And Kellogg Hike Prices On Selected Food Products  Article: After denying for months that surging food prices will eventually come to the consumer, hoping that instead food companies could absorb the margin drop, sellside research is finally capitulating to the reality of what is really happening in the retail store. In a note discussing General Mills, Goldman Sachs says the company raised prices on snack bars some 7% last week. Goldman further clarifies that ""this reportedly followed a comparable increase taken by K on its snack bars in mid-December. In addition, KFT has reportedly announced a 6% increase on select Planters branded nut products. We expect more price increases to be announced by the food companies in the coming weeks."" Maybe, but the Chairman sure doesn't. And the Chairman is always 100% correct. Other observations from Goldman on what are now seen as inevitable price increases across numerous food verticals. These pricing actions support our Food sector view that price momentum will continue to build as 2011 progresses, driven by easing promotional spending and list price increases (see our 1/5 report, Time to embrace inflation; Upgrade Food to Neutral, GIS to buy). This should drive top-line acceleration and margin stabilization over the course of 2011. Evidence of the progression is already apparent in retail scanner data (see our 1/11 report, Progression to a less bad promo environment continues). Scanner data is likely to continue to show a measured pace of price growth.",0
"Title: Racists Use Wireless Networks To Propagate Hatred  Article: By Ray Charlston Racists around the world have discovered a new way of promoting hatred. Following the recommendations of Edward Thompson, an online blogger, racists have begun re-naming their wireless networks Race Realist or Race Realism in an attempt to intimidate minorities and spread their intolerant views. Authorities are currently investigating whether this action constitutes hate-speech, which is illegal in most of Europe but not in the US yet. For those who do not know, a wireless network refers to a computer network. In this case, one operating from an individuals home or business which provides wireless internet access for him or her, often for a family, or an office. For some time now, individuals have been able to select a name or designation of their choice for their wireless network. Computers in the vicinity of a wireless network will often automatically detect it, listing the name of a local network or networks. On his very offensive, racist, sexist, and homophobic blog, Edward Thompson states that his purpose is to Spread an awareness of Race Realism. He states that when a computer detects the wireless network, and people see the name Race Realist it may spike their curiosity or interest. They may do an internet search to find out more information. Its great free publicity that costs nothing more than ones existing internet service subscription. Thompson, while claiming that Race Realist is his favourite wireless network name, also suggests that racist individuals might alternate between names or vary them in order to reach neighbours or others in their vicinity with multiple offensive concepts.",1

"Title: UK Lord Asks If Mosques Will Be Monitored For Hate Speech - Gets Threatened With Hate Speech Prosecution For Asking  Article: A chronicle of a society in its death throes: Lord Pearson asks if Her Majestys Government whether, in pursuit of their anti-terrorism strategy, will require preaching in mosques and teaching in madrassas in England and Wales to be monitored for hate speech against non-Muslims. In response, the Muslim Baroness Warsi issues a warning: I shall be really careful how I phrase this with reference to the original Question. Could I ask Her Majestys Government whether, in pursuit of their antiterrorism strategy, they will require preaching in the form of Oral Questions and debate in your Lordships House to be monitored for hate speech and Islamophobia against Muslims? So the question of whether the government will monitor the mosques for hate speech is thrust aside, and Pearson is threatened for his Islamophobia. Everyone present except for Lord Pearson appears to assume that all the mosques in the UK teach peace and brotherhood, and that this should not be questioned.

"Title: Terror threat raised as Cotswolds Vicar declares Church of England CaliphateNewsBiscuit  Article: With much of the world distracted by the campaign against ISIS in the Middle East, Britain faces a new home-grown terror threat, after Stow-In- the-Wold vicar Jeremy Blythe pronounced an independent Anglican Caliphate stretching across much of rural Oxfordshire. We have seized control of the parish councils of Stow, Coln St Aldwyns and Daglingworth, announced Blythe this morning, and as I speak, our forces are advancing on Shipston on Stour. Asked why he had taken this action, Blythe explained We are sick of your Western materialistic values, with your Minidisc players and Sodastreams. We intend to go back to a purer time, when vicars wobbled about on bicycles, all vergers looked like Derek Nimmo and Cliff Richard was never anything other than non-threatening. While information from inside the Caliphate remains scarce, an Amnesty International report has already detailed a catalogue of human rights abuses, describing the number of forced jumble sales as shockingly high. The subjugation of women was also a big concern, with reports that some old ladies were being forced to bake up to twenty trays of flapjacks every day. Despite this, support for the Caliphate appears to be on the rise, with large numbers of foreign fighters flocking to the region. Wendy Briggs of Runcorn, described how her own son, Gary, had been radicalised. He was just a normal teenager really, you know, sullen and argumentative with stupid hair, but gradually he started to change. I should have seen the signs really.

"Title: Jeff Sessions, Just What Side of the Constitution are You on?  Article: I'm so sick and tired of wishy-washy politicians who talk a good game and when it comes time for action, they go AWOL. Such is the case with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Before you blast me, hear me out. Most of you who read what I write know I'm not a liberal. So, if anyone wants to bash me as such, you are doing so knowing you are misrepresenting me. Has Jeff Sessions done some good things? Of course! He's taken a verbal stand for the Constitution when it comes to authorization for war. Of course, he failed to actually bring any resolve in the matter. He's also overseen a lot of enforcement of both immigration law and child pornography and human trafficking arrests. However, let me lay out a specific case in which Jeff Sessions, a proponent of unconstitutional asset forfeiture, speaks regarding free speech. First, consider a recent speech by Sessions in which he warned about the Supreme Court's ruling concerning unconstitutional ""free speech zones,"" whatever those are. Following the speech, I'll demonstrate the hypocrisy that is going one. Here's the speech. Thank you for that kind introduction. I am so pleased to be here at Georgetown Law and to be speaking at the Georgetown Center for the Constitution where the exchange of ideas is both welcomed and encouraged. Thank you, Professor Barnett for that introduction and for hosting me here with your students. And thank you students for letting me take part in this important conversation with you.

"Title: Vice President Clark?  Article: Most people know the rumors, Clark almost was Kerry's VP in 2004. The problem then with Clark in general was the party didn't feel he had paid his dues. So, the slot went to John Edwards. Who by all accounts deserved being nominated. But, in the outgoing interview the former DNC Chairman was asked why in two words we lost the Presidential Election in 2004. His response, ""National Security"". We had the advantage in 2008, I think but there is nothing in life that is a guarantee. We need to have someone on the ticket who has National Security experience. Unfortunately, most of the leading contenders do not. That's okay, there is no requirement in our constitution to have military or National Security experience to be the Commander in Chief. But isn't it going to be useful in 2008? Aren't we going to have one hell of a mess on our hands? Isn't it going to be easier to convince Moderates and Independents in this country that we aren't ""far left"". We have a second chance, a second opportunity to get things right in 2008. John Kerry and John Edwards aren't in the White House because of National Security. Kerry's War Service, was not enough. So who do we have? Bob Kerry, out. Jack Reed, out. John Kerry, out. Then there's one of my hero's Jim Webb. Former Naval Secretary, Vietnam War Hero, and U.S. Marine. However, right now his best use is in the U.S. Senate where he was been working for us for the past 4 months. So that leaves us with the other hero of mine, General Wesley Clark.

"Title: Trump Humiliates Himself By Claiming That There Is No Drought In California %%  Article: Donald Trump humiliated himself by claiming that the California drought doesnt exist and that he will solve the states problems by turning the water back on. Video: Trump said: Were going to solve your water problem. You have a water problem that is so insane. It is so ridiculous where theyre taking the water and shoving it out to seaThey dont understand  nobody understands it. There is no drought. .. I have received many many environmental rewards. Rewards and awards. I have done very well environmentally, and Im all for it, but you have some people that really just wanna get in the way, and I dont know if its for their ego or what. But you know we want jobs, we have to bring jobs back, and if we can bring this part of the world water that we have, but its true Ive gotten so many of the awards and I am proud of them, and there are some great environmentalists.If I win, were going to start opening up the water, so that you can have your farmers survive. According to Trump, the drought is a conspiracy from environmentalists that he will solve simply by turning the water back on to the farms. Unless Donald Trump has a secret weather machine, the only thing that can solve Californias water issues is more rain. Donald Trump like the rest of the members of his party is trying to pass off denial as a public policy. Pretending that the drought doesnt exist is not a solution. The fact that his supporters in Fresno, CA ate up Trumps rambling non-solution suggests how deeply the culture of believe it until it is true has infested the Republican Party.

"Title: USA: Confederate Army General Revealed to Be a Woman  Article: Austin | George Edward Pickett, a Confederate Army General who played a major role in the last days of the Battle of Gettysburg, was in fact a woman. Newly disclosed information found in the last will of George Picketts father, Colonel Robert Pickett, proves without a doubt the confederate war general was a woman. The discovery was made at an auction in Austin, Texas, this week as american historian Graham Brown got his hands on the precious document. The will proves without a doubt the famous general who participated in the Battle of Gettysburg was in fact Mary Sue Pickett, his older sister. It also appears clearly evident that George Edward Pickett was never part of any military enterprise, but instead, that his sister was in fact the real man behind the legend. Mary Sue Pickett, who was George Picketts senior by one year, was also known to suffer from a rare genetic disorder known as hypertrichosis, a condition where an excess of androgen creates an hormonal unbalance that results in female beard growth. Official documents of the Pickett family released at the auction included documents confirming the death by tuberculosis of George Pickett at the tender age of 16. The death of the only boy of the family of eight possibly devastated his father, Colonel Robert Pickett, who dreamed of leaving a family military legacy behind him. It was not uncommon at the time to fake documents or steal someones identity.",0

A man who wishes to remain anonymous recently told End Times News Reports Jake Morphonios that there were multiple gunmen on the corner of Mandalay Bay Rd and Las Vegas Blvd at 9:50 p.m., ten minutes before the shooting officially started. The man told End Times News Report that he was up in the Delano hanging out with some friends on the night of October 1 when a female friend of his decided to grab an Uber and and go meet up with some other friends of hers at another location.

"Title: Once Again Our Islamist President Uses His Authority to Cut Military Pay  Article: Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE Obama has for the second year in row used his executive powers to put a cap on pay raises for our loyal armed forces Once Again Our Islamist President Uses His Authority to Cut Military Pay Its just not right for the President of the United States to be a lap dog for any foreign entity and even more so if that favored group is a terrorist inclined quasi religious gathering of foreigners who are anti-American at heart. This current occupant of our Oval Office fits that description totally. Obama has for the second year in row used his executive powers to put a cap on pay raises for our loyal armed forces and is repeating the mistakes of past administrations that were intent on degrading and insulting to our military by not allowing legitimate pay increases. According to a letter from the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) dated September 5, 2014 an active duty pay raise is determined by private sector wage growth, measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI calls for a 1.8 percent pay raise in 2015. According to the MOAA letter, From 2000 to 2012, Congress worked hard to eliminate a 13.5 percent military pay gap with the private sector caused by repeatedly capping military raises in the 1980s and 90s. But the restoration of military pay comparability with the private sector is under threat. Pay has been capped for two years, and the administrations FY 2015 budget proposes to continue caps for a total of six years.",0
"Title: The Just Firing of Andrew McCabe  Article: Based on the recommendation of career officials in the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe late Friday for good cause. The dismissal occurred less than two days before McCabe was planning to retire and become eligible to receive lucrative pension benefits. ""After an extensive and fair investigation and according to Department of Justice procedure, the Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) provided its report on allegations of misconduct by Andrew McCabe to the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR),"" Sessions said in a statement Friday. ""The FBI's OPR then reviewed the report and underlying documents and issued a disciplinary proposal recommending the dismissal of Mr. McCabe. Both the OIG and FBI OPR reports concluded that Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor  including under oath  on multiple occasions. The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability. As the OPR proposal stated, all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand. Pursuant to Department Order 1202, and based on the report of the Inspector General, the findings of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility, and the recommendation of the Departments senior career official, I have terminated the employment of Andrew McCabe effective immediately.",0
"Title: Supreme Court Makes Unanimous Ruling Against The Trump Administration (DETAILS)  Article: Before the Trump administration finally found itself able to claim a significant legislative victory because of the tax reform plan in late 2017, the president marked his time in office by presiding over the shredding of as much pre-existing regulation as possible, no matter the cost. One of the regulations up for the chopping block was the Waters of the United States rule, an Obama era move that formally extended the governments authority to curtail pollution to small waterways. The original move proved controversial among industry interests because of the cost of complying with the regulations. In the aftermath of the rules implementation, interests in the matter brought dozens of lawsuits against the government, and in one of them, the Supreme Court has just unanimously ruled against the government  in other words, against the Trump administration. The ruling is not on the merits of the rule itself, but rather on the proper court for hearing challenges to the rule in question. The Trump administration has asserted that courts of appeals are the proper venue for such challenges, while industry interests have insisted that district courts are the proper venue.",0

Yet in past centuries people have defected to Cuba  white French agriculturalists fleeing the slave rebellion in nearby Haiti and black sugar cane cutters from Curacao searching for a post-slavery future. Several covetous American presidents tried to buy Cuba outright in cash. Former Soviets and modern Russians come to Cuba, as do millions of foreign tourists. The reasons for coming are legion, as are the recriminations and accusations Cubans and Americans lob at one another like errant missiles. Despite the rhetoric of a socialist paradise, complete with unrelenting sunshine, pristine white sandy beaches, exotic women, first-rate nationalized health care, universal education, racial harmony, sweet cigars and lively music, Cuba is only now coming to terms with her 21st century identity crisis.
